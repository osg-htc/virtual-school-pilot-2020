Gaining access is critical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLogging In\n\u00b6\n\n\nToday, you will use a submit server named \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, which will allow you to submit jobs to our local HTCondor pool in CHTC.\n\n\nTo log in, use a \nSecure Shell\n (SSH) client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Mac or Linux computer, run the Terminal app and use the \nssh\n command, like so:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ssh \n<USERNAME>\n@learn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows, we recommend a free client called \nPuTTY\n,\n    but any SSH client should be fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need help finding or using an SSH client, ask the instructors for help right away\n!\n\n\nAbout Your Password\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour mentor should have given you your username and password.\n    If this is not true or you have lost the password, reach out to any staff member for help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the \npasswd\n command will work (and will change your password temporarily),\n    your initial password will be automatically reset for you on an hourly basis.\n    So consider not changing your password and save the one provided in a secure place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Commands\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the exercises, we will show commands that you are supposed to type or copy into the command line, like this:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n hostname\n\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn the first line of the example above, the \nusername@learn $\n part is meant to show the Linux command-line prompt.\nYou do not type this part! Further, your actual prompt probably is a bit different, and that is expected.\nSo in the example above, the command that you type at your own prompt is just the eight characters \nhostname\n.\nThe second line of the example, without the prompt, shows the output of the command; you do not type this part,\neither.\n\n\n\n\nHere are a few other commands that you can try (the examples below do not show the output from each command):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n whoami\n\nusername@learn $\n date\n\nusername@learn $\n uname -a\n\n\n\n\n\nA suggestion for the day: try typing into the command line as many of the commands as you can.\nCopy-and-paste is fine, of course, but \nyou WILL learn more if you take the time to type each command yourself.\n\n\nOrganizing Your Workspace\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou will be doing many different exercises over the next few days, many of them on this submit server. Each exercise may use many files, once finished. To avoid confusion, it may be useful to create a separate directory for each exercise.\n\n\nFor instance, for the rest of this exercise, you may wish to create and use a directory named \nintro-1.1-login\n, or something like that.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n mkdir intro-1.1-login\n\nusername@learn $\n \ncd\n intro-1.1-login\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing the Version of HTCondor\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor is installed on this server. But what version? You can ask HTCondor itself:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_version\n\n$\nCondorVersion: \n8\n.9.8 Jun \n29\n \n2020\n BuildID: \n508520\n PackageID: \n8\n.9.8-0.508520 $\n\n$\nCondorPlatform: x86_64_CentOS7 $\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the output, we are using HTCondor 8.9.8.\n\n\nFYI: Background information about HTCondor version numbers\n\u00b6\n\n\nHTCondor always has two types of releases at one time: stable and development. HTCondor 8.6.x and 8.8.x are considered stable releases, indicated by even-numbered second digits (e.g., 6 or 8 in these cases). Within one stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 8.6.0 and 8.6.8 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug and security fixes.\n\n\nHTCondor 8.9.8 is the latest \ndevelopment\n release series of HTCondor. You know that these are a development release because the second digit (i.e., 9) is an odd number. CHTC is usually running the latest development series as the local CHTC Pool is somewhat of a final testing ground for new features. Other HTCondor pools and submit servers that you use outside of CHTC (including the OSG submit server you'll use later) may run different versions. In general, the user-facing HTCondor features in 8.6 forward are mostly the same, but you may see some differences in the format of output from \ncondor_\n commands or in more advanced or non-user features.\n\n\nReference Materials\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere are a few links to reference materials that might be interesting after the school (or perhaps during).\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor home page\n\n\nHTCondor manuals\n; it is probably best to read the manual corresponding to the version of HTCondor that you use. That link points to the latest version of the manual, but you can switch versions using the toggle in the lower left corner of that page.\n\n\nCenter for High Throughput Computing\n, our campus research computing center, and home to HTCondor and other development of distributed computing tools.",

The final row gives a summary of slot states for the whole pool.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run \ncondor_status\n, how many 64-bit Linux slots are available? (Hint: Unclaimed = available.)\n\n\nWhat percent of the total slots are currently claimed by a job? (Note: there is a rapid turnover of slots, which is what allows users with new submission to have jobs start quickly.)\n\n\nHow have these numbers changed (if at all) when you run the command again?\n\n\n\n\nViewing Whole Machines, Only\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlso try out the \n-compact\n for a slightly different view of whole machines (i.e. server hostnames), without the individual slots shown.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -compact\n\n\n\n\n\nHow has the column information changed?\n\n\nViewing Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \ncondor_q\n command lists jobs that are on this submit machine and that are running or waiting to run.

This is a huge step in learning to use an HTC system!\n\n\nThis exercise will take longer than the first two, short ones. It is the essential part of this exercise time. If you are having any problems getting the jobs to run, please ask the instructors! It is very important that you know how to run jobs.\n\n\nRunning Your First Job\n\u00b6\n\n\nNearly all of the time, when you want to run an HTCondor job, you first write an HTCondor submit file for it. In this section, you will run the same \nhostname\n command as in Exercise 1.1, but where this command will run within a job on one of the 'execute' servers in CHTC's local HTCondor pool.\n\n\nHere is a straightforward submit file for the \nhostname\n command:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\n\noutput = hostname.out\nerror = hostname.err\nlog = hostname.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite those lines of text in a file named \nhostname.sub\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere is nothing magic about the name of an HTCondor submit file.\nIt can be any filename you want.\nIt's a good practice to always include the \n.sub\n extension, but it is not required.\nUltimately, a submit file is a text file\n\n\n\n\nThe lines of the submit file have the following meanings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexecutable\n\n\nThe name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\noutput\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\nThe filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. While not required, it is a \nreally\n good idea to have a log file for every job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequest_*\n\n\nTells HTCondor how many \ncpus\n and how much \nmemory\n and \ndisk\n we want, which is not much, because the 'hostname' executable is very small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqueue\n\n\nTells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we are not using the \narguments\n or \ntransfer_input_files\n lines that were mentioned during lecture because the \nhostname\n program is all that needs to be transferred from the submit server, and we want to run it without any additional options.\n\n\nDouble-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit hostname.sub\n\nSubmitting job(s).\n\n\n1 job(s) submitted to cluster NNNN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual cluster number will be shown instead of \nNNNN\n. \nIf, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file or ask for help.\n\n\nNotice that \ncondor_submit\n returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does \nnot\n wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes.\n\n\nView your job in the queue\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow, use \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n to watch for your job in the queue! \n\n\nYou may not even catch the job in the \nR\n running state, because the \nhostname\n command runs very quickly. When the job itself is finished, it will 'leave' the queue and no longer be listed in the \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\nAfter the job finishes, check for the \nhostname\n output in \nhostname.out\n, which is where job information printed to the terminal screen will be printed for the job.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n cat hostname.out\n\ne171.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nhostname.err\n file should be empty, unless there were issues running the \nhostname\n executable after it was transferred to the slot. The \nhostname.log\n is more complex and will be the focus of a later exercise.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Arguments\n\u00b6\n\n\nVery often, when you run a command on the command line, it includes arguments (i.e. options) after the program name, as in the below examples:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n cat hostname.out\n\nusername@learn $\n sleep \n60\n\n\nusername@learn $\n dc -e \n'6 7 * p'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an HTCondor submit file, the program (or 'executable') name goes in the \nexecutable\n statement and \nall remaining arguments\n go into an \narguments\n statement. For example, if the full command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n sleep \n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen in the submit file, we would put the location of the \"sleep\" program (you can find it with \nwhich sleep\n) as the job \nexecutable\n, and \n60\n as the job \narguments\n:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\narguments = 60\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the command-line command:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n dc -e \n'6 7 * p'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would put the following into the submit file, putting the \narguments\n statement in quotes, since it contains single quotes:\n\n\nexecutable = /usr/bin/dc\narguments = \"-e '6 7 * p'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s try a job submission with arguments. We will use the \nsleep\n command shown above, which simply does nothing for the specified number of seconds, then exits normally. It is convenient for simulating a job that takes a while to run.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file (you name it this time) and save the following text in it.\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/sleep\narguments = 60\n\noutput = sleep.out\nerror = sleep.err\nlog = sleep.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for changing a few filenames, this submit file is nearly identical to the last one. But, see the extra \narguments\n line?\n\n\nSubmit this new job. Again, watch for it to run using \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n; \ncheck once every 15 seconds or so. \nOnce the job starts running, it will take about 1 minute to run (because of the \nsleep\n command, right?), \nso you should be able to see it running for a bit. \nWhen the job finishes, it will disappear from the queue, but there will be no output in the output or error files, because \nsleep\n does not produce any output.\n\n\nRunning a Script Job From the Submit Directory\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have been running programs (executables) that come with the standard Linux system. \nMore frequently, you will want to run a program that exists within your directory \nor perhaps a shell script of commands that you'd like to run within a job. In this example, you will write a shell script and a submit file that runs the shell script within a job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut the following contents into a file named \ntest-script.sh\n:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\necho\n \n'Date: '\n \n`\ndate\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'Host: '\n \n`\nhostname\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'System: '\n \n`\nuname -spo\n`\n \n\necho\n \n\"Program: \n$0\n\"\n \n\necho\n \n\"Args: \n$*\n\"\n\n\necho\n \n'ls: '\n \n`\nls\n`\n\n\n# END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd executable permissions to the file (so that it can be run as a program):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n chmod +x test-script.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest your script from the command line:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ./test-script.sh hello \n42\n \n\nDate: Mon Jul 17 10:02:20 CDT 2017 \n\n\nHost: learn.chtc.wisc.edu \n\n\nSystem: Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux \n\n\nProgram: ./test-script.sh\n\n\nArgs: hello 42\n\n\nls: hostname.sub montage hostname.err hostname.log hostname.out test-script.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is \nreally\n important! If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. \nFurther, debugging problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. \nSo, if possible, test your \nexecutable\n and \narguments\n as a command at the command-line first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the submit file (this should be getting easier by now):\n\n\nexecutable = test-script.sh\narguments = foo bar baz\n\noutput = script.out\nerror = script.err\nlog = script.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the \nexecutable\n that was named in the submit file did \nnot\n start with a \n/\n, \n    so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. \n    In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBlank lines between commands and spaces around the \n=\n do not matter to HTCondor.\nFor example, this submit file is equivalent to the one above:\n\n\nexecutable = test-script.sh\narguments =  foo bar baz\noutput =     script.out\nerror =      script.err\nlog =        script.log\n\nrequest_cpus=1\nrequest_memory=1GB\nrequest_disk=1MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nUse whitespace to make things clear to \nyou\n. \nWhat format do you prefer to read?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output (and error, which should be empty).\n\n\nWhat do you notice about the lines returned for \"Program\" and \"ls\"? Remember that only files pertaining\nto \nthis\n job will be in the job working directory on the execute server. You're also seeing the effects\nof HTCondor's need to standardize some filenames when running your job, though they are named as you expect \nin the submission directory (per the submit file contents).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Challenge\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThere are Extra Challenges throughout the school curriculum. You may be better off coming back to these after you've completed all other exercises for your current working session.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a Python script that does something similar to the shell script above.

In this section, you will run the same  hostname  command as in Exercise 1.1, but where this command will run within a job on one of the 'execute' servers in CHTC's local HTCondor pool.  Here is a straightforward submit file for the  hostname  command:  executable = /bin/hostname\n\noutput = hostname.out\nerror = hostname.err\nlog = hostname.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue  Write those lines of text in a file named  hostname.sub .   Note  There is nothing magic about the name of an HTCondor submit file.\nIt can be any filename you want.\nIt's a good practice to always include the  .sub  extension, but it is not required.\nUltimately, a submit file is a text file   The lines of the submit file have the following meanings:           executable  The name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit).    output  The filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job.    error  The filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job.    log  The filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. While not required, it is a  really  good idea to have a log file for every job.    request_*  Tells HTCondor how many  cpus  and how much  memory  and  disk  we want, which is not much, because the 'hostname' executable is very small.    queue  Tells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above.     Note that we are not using the  arguments  or  transfer_input_files  lines that were mentioned during lecture because the  hostname  program is all that needs to be transferred from the submit server, and we want to run it without any additional options.  Double-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job:  username@learn $  condor_submit hostname.sub Submitting job(s).  1 job(s) submitted to cluster NNNN.   The actual cluster number will be shown instead of  NNNN .  If, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file or ask for help.  Notice that  condor_submit  returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does  not  wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes.",

For example, if the full command is:  username@learn $  sleep  60   Then in the submit file, we would put the location of the \"sleep\" program (you can find it with  which sleep ) as the job  executable , and  60  as the job  arguments :  executable = /bin/sleep\narguments = 60  For the command-line command:  username@learn $  dc -e  '6 7 * p'   We would put the following into the submit file, putting the  arguments  statement in quotes, since it contains single quotes:  executable = /usr/bin/dc\narguments = \"-e '6 7 * p'\"  Let\u2019s try a job submission with arguments.

In this example, you will write a shell script and a submit file that runs the shell script within a job:    Put the following contents into a file named  test-script.sh :  #!/bin/sh  echo   'Date: '   ` date `   echo   'Host: '   ` hostname `   echo   'System: '   ` uname -spo `   echo   \"Program:  $0 \"   echo   \"Args:  $* \"  echo   'ls: '   ` ls `  # END     Add executable permissions to the file (so that it can be run as a program):  username@learn $  chmod +x test-script.sh    Test your script from the command line:  username@learn $  ./test-script.sh hello  42   Date: Mon Jul 17 10:02:20 CDT 2017   Host: learn.chtc.wisc.edu   System: Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux   Program: ./test-script.sh  Args: hello 42  ls: hostname.sub montage hostname.err hostname.log hostname.out test-script.sh   This step is  really  important! If you cannot run your executable from the command-line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine, either. \nFurther, debugging problems like this one is surprisingly difficult. \nSo, if possible, test your  executable  and  arguments  as a command at the command-line first.    Write the submit file (this should be getting easier by now):  executable = test-script.sh\narguments = foo bar baz\n\noutput = script.out\nerror = script.err\nlog = script.log\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1MB\n\nqueue  In this example, the  executable  that was named in the submit file did  not  start with a  / , \n    so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. \n    In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file.   Note  Blank lines between commands and spaces around the  =  do not matter to HTCondor.\nFor example, this submit file is equivalent to the one above:  executable = test-script.sh\narguments =  foo bar baz\noutput =     script.out\nerror =      script.err\nlog =        script.log\n\nrequest_cpus=1\nrequest_memory=1GB\nrequest_disk=1MB\n\nqueue  Use whitespace to make things clear to  you . \nWhat format do you prefer to read?     Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output (and error, which should be empty).  What do you notice about the lines returned for \"Program\" and \"ls\"? Remember that only files pertaining\nto  this  job will be in the job working directory on the execute server.

The example output below is based on the \nsleep 60\n job.\n\n\nA job log file is updated throughout the life of a job, usually at key events.

This can be helpful information, so that in future runs of the job, you can tell HTCondor how much memory you will need.\n\n\nThe job termination event includes a great deal of additional information:\n\n\n005 (5739.000.000) 2020-07-10 10:46:11 Job terminated.\n    (1) Normal termination (return value 0)\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Remote Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Run Local Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Remote Usage\n        Usr 0 00:00:00, Sys 0 00:00:00  -  Total Local Usage\n    0  -  Run Bytes Sent By Job\n    27848  -  Run Bytes Received By Job\n    0  -  Total Bytes Sent By Job\n    27848  -  Total Bytes Received By Job\n    Partitionable Resources :    Usage  Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk (KB)            :       40       30   4203309\n       Memory (MB)          :        1        1         1\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nProbably the most interesting information is:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nreturn value\n (\n0\n here, means the executable completed and didn't indicate any internal errors; non-zero usually means failure)\n\n\nThe total number of bytes transferred each way, which could be useful if your network is slow\n\n\nThe \nPartitionable Resources\n table, especially disk and memory usage, which will inform larger submissions.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other kinds of events, but the ones above will occur in almost every job log.\n\n\nUnderstanding When Job Log Events Are Written\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen are events written to the job log file? Let\u2019s find out. Read through the entire procedure below before starting, because some parts of the process are time sensitive.\n\n\n\n\nChange the \nsleep\n job submit file, so that the job sleeps for 2 minutes (= 120 seconds)\n\n\nSubmit the updated sleep job\n\n\nAs soon as the \ncondor_submit\n command finishes, hit the return key a few times, to create some blank lines\n\n\n\n\nRight away, run a command to show the log file and \nkeep showing\n updates as they occur:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n tail -f sleep.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the output carefully. When do events appear in the log file?\n\n\n\n\nAfter the termination event appears, press Control-C to end the \ntail\n command and return to the shell prompt.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding How HTCondor Writes Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen HTCondor writes the output, error, and log files, does it erase the previous contents of the file or does it add new lines onto the end? Let\u2019s find out!\n\n\nFor this exercise, we can use the \nhostname\n job from earlier.\n\n\n\n\nEdit the \nhostname\n submit file so that it uses new and unique filenames for output, error, and log files.\n\nAlternatively, delete any existing output, error, and log files from previous runs of the \nhostname\n job.\n\n\nSubmit the job three separate times in a row (there are better ways to do this, which we will cover in the next lecture)\n\n\nWait for all three jobs to finish\n\n\nExamine the output file: How many hostnames are there? Did HTCondor erase the previous contents for each job, or add new lines?\n\n\nExamine the log file\u2026 carefully: What happened there? Pay close attention to the times and job IDs of the events.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about how HTCondor handles these files, you could try finding relevant sections of the manual (this is hard and not as useful as one would hope), discuss it with neighbors or instructors, or ask questions at the end of this session.",

In many HTCondor pools:\n\n\n\n\nIf your job goes over the request values, it may be removed from the execute machine and held (status 'H' in the \ncondor_q\n output, awaiting action on your part) without saving any partial job output files. So it is a disadvantage to not declare your resource needs or if you underestimate them. \n\n\nConversely, if you overestimate them by too much, your jobs will match to fewer slots, with a longer average wait time. Additionally, by hogging up resources that you don't need, other users may be deprived of the resources they require. In the long run, it works better for all users of the pool if you declare what you really need.\n\n\n\n\nBut how do you know what to request? In particular, we are concerned with memory and disk here; requesting multiple CPUs and using them is covered a bit in later school materials, but true HTC splits work up into jobs that each use as few CPU cores as possible (one CPU core is always best to have the most jobs running and completing soonest).\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs Before Running Any Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you are running short on time, you can skip to \"Determining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs\", below, but try to come back and read over this part at some point.\n\n\n\n\nIt can be very difficult to predict the memory needs of your running program without running tests. Typically, the memory size of a job changes over time, making the task even trickier. \nIf you have knowledge ahead of time about your job\u2019s maximum memory needs, use that, or a maybe a number that's just a bit higher, to be safe. Worst case scenario, you can request a fairly large amount of memory (as high as what's on your laptop or other server, if you know your program can run without crashing) for a first test job, OR you can run the program locally and 'watch' it:\n\n\nExamining a Running Program on a Local Computer\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen working on a shared submit server, you should not run computationally-intensive work because it can use resources needed by HTCondor to manage the queue for all uses. \nHowever, you may have access to other computers (your laptop, for example, or another server) where you can observe the memory usage of a program. The downside is that you'll have to watch a program run for essentially the entire time, to make sure you catch the maximum memory usage.\n\n\nFor Memory:\n\u00b6\n\n\nOn Mac and Windows, for example, the \"Activity Monitor\" and \"Task Manager\" applications may be useful. On a Mac or Linux system, you can use the \nps\n command or the \ntop\n command in the Terminal to watch a running program and see (roughly) how much memory it is using. Full coverage of these tools is beyond the scope of this exercise, but here are two quick examples:\n\n\nUsing \nps\n:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n ps ux\n\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\n\n\ncat      24342  0.0  0.0  90224  1864 ?

If your program runs long enough, you can run this command several times and note the greatest value.\n\n\nUsing \ntop\n:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n top -u <USERNAME>\n\ntop - 13:55:31 up 11 days, 20:59,  5 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.12, 0.09\n\n\nTasks: 198 total,   1 running, 197 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie\n\n\nCpu(s):  1.2%us,  0.1%sy,  0.0%ni, 98.5%id,  0.2%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.1%si,  0.0%st\n\n\nMem:   4001440k total,  3558028k used,   443412k free,   258568k buffers\n\n\nSwap:  4194296k total,      148k used,  4194148k free,  2960760k cached\n\n\n\n  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND\n\n\n24342 cat       15   0 90224 1864 1096 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.26 sshd\n\n\n24343 cat       15   0 66096 1580 1232 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.07 bash\n\n\n25927 cat       15   0 12760 1196  836 R  0.0  0.0   0:00.01 top\n\n\n30052 cat       16   0 90720 2456 1112 S  0.0  0.1   0:00.69 sshd\n\n\n30053 cat       18   0 66096 1624 1236 S  0.0  0.0   0:00.37 bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ntop\n command (shown here with an option to limit the output to a single user ID) also shows information about running processes, but updates periodically by itself. Type the letter \nq\n to quit the interactive display. Again, the highlighted \nRES\n column shows an approximation of memory usage.\n\n\nFor Disk:\n\u00b6\n\n\nDetermining disk needs may be a bit easier, because you can check on the size of files that a program is using while it runs. However, it is important to count all files that HTCondor counts to get an accurate size. HTCondor counts \neverything\n in your job sandbox toward your job\u2019s disk usage:\n\n\n\n\nThe executable itself\n\n\nAll \"input\" files (anything else that gets transferred TO the job, even if you don't think of it as \"input\")\n\n\nAll files created during the job (broadly defined as \"output\"), including the captured standard output and error files that you list in the submit file.\n\n\nAll temporary files created in the sandbox, even if they get deleted by the executable before it's done.\n\n\n\n\nIf you can run your program within a single directory on a local computer (not on the submit server), you should be able to view files and their sizes with the \nls\n and \ndu\n commands.\n\n\nDetermining Resource Needs By Running Test Jobs (BEST)\n\u00b6\n\n\nDespite the techniques mentioned above, by far the easiest approach to measuring your job\u2019s resource needs is to run one or a small number of sample jobs and have HTCondor itself tell you about the resources used during the runs.\n\n\nFor example, here is a strange Python script that does not do anything useful, but consumes some real resources while running:\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nsize\n \n=\n \n1000000\n\n\nnumbers\n \n=\n \n[]\n\n\nfor\n \ni\n \nin\n \nxrange\n(\nsize\n):\n \nnumbers\n.\nappend\n(\nstr\n(\ni\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\n'numbers.txt'\n,\n \n'w'\n)\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nwrite\n(\n' '\n.\njoin\n(\nnumbers\n))\n\n\ntempfile\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n60\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout trying to figure out what this code does or how many resources it uses, create a submit file for it, \nand run it once with HTCondor, starting with somewhat high memory requests (\"1GB\" for memory and disk is a good starting point, unless you think the job will use far more).\nWhen it is done, examine the log file. In particular, we care about these lines:\n\n\n    Partitionable Resources :    Usage  Request Allocated\n       Cpus                 :                 1         1\n       Disk (KB)            :     6739  1048576   8022934\n       Memory (MB)          :        3     1024      1024\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, now we know that HTCondor saw that the job used 6,739 KB of disk (= about 6.5 MB) and 3 MB of memory!\n\n\nThis is a great technique for determining the real resource needs of your job. If you think resource needs vary from run to run, submit a few sample jobs and look at all the results. And it never hurts to round up your resource requests a little, just in case your job occasionally uses more resources.\n\n\nSetting Resource Requirements\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you know your job\u2019s resource requirements, it is easy to declare them in your submit file. For example, taking our results above as an example, we might slightly increase our requests above what was used, just to be safe:\n\n\nrequest_memory = 4MB  \n# rounded up from 3 MB\n\nrequest_disk = 7MB  \n# rounded up from 6.5 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay close attention to units:\n\n\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_memory\n is in MB (megabytes)\n\n\nWithout explicit units, \nrequest_disk\n is in KB (kilobytes)\n\n\nAllowable units are \nKB\n (kilobytes), \nMB\n (megabytes), \nGB\n (gigabytes), and \nTB\n (terabytes)\n\n\n\n\nHTCondor translates these requirements into attributes that become part of the job's \nrequirements\n expression. However, do not put your CPU, memory, and disk requirements directly into the \nrequirements\n expression; use the \nrequest_XXX\n statements instead.\n\n\nIf you still have time in this working session, Add these requirements to your submit file for the Python script, rerun the job, and confirm in the log file that your requests were used.\n\n\nAfter changing the requirements in your submit file, did your job run successfully? If not, why?\n(Hint: HTCondor polls a job's resource use on a timer. How long are these jobs running for?)",

This is helpful if you make a mistake, do not want to wait for a job to complete, or otherwise need to fix things.

This small change significantly adds to the kinds of jobs that you can run.\n\n\nViewing a Job Sandbox\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you learn to transfer files to and from your job, it is good to understand a bit more about the environment in which your job runs.\nWhen the HTCondor \nstarter\n process prepares to run your job, it creates a new directory for your job and all of its files.\nWe call this directory the \njob sandbox\n, because it is your job\u2019s private space to play.\nLet\u2019s see what is in the job sandbox for a minimal job with no special input or output files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the script below in a file named \nsandbox.sh\n:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\necho\n \n'Date: '\n \n`\ndate\n`\n\n\necho\n \n'Host: '\n \n`\nhostname\n`\n \n\necho\n \n'Sandbox: '\n \n`\npwd\n`\n \nls -alF\n\n# END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a submit file for this script and submit it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the job finishes, look at the contents of the output file.\n\n\n\n\nIn the output file, note the \nSandbox:\n line: That is the full path to your job sandbox for the run. It was created just for your job, and it was removed as soon as your job finished.\n\n\nNext, look at the output that appears after the \nSandbox:\n line; it is the output from the \nls\n command in the script. It shows all of the files in your job sandbox, as they existed at the end of the execution of \nsandbox.sh\n. The files are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.chirp.config\n\n\nConfiguration for an advanced feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.job.ad\n\n\nThe job ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.machine.ad\n\n\nThe machine ClassAd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stderr\n\n\nSaved standard error from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_condor_stdout\n\n\nSaved standard output from the job\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor_exec.exe\n\n\nThe executable, renamed from \nsandbox.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmp/\n, \nvar/tmp/\n\n\nDirectories in which to put temporary files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable (\nsandbox.sh\n), renamed it (\ncondor_exec.exe\n), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was \nnot\n transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file.\n\n\nNow that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it.\n\n\nRunning a Job With Input Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, you will run a job that requires an input file. Remember, the initial job sandbox will contain only the renamed job executable, unless you tell HTCondor explicitly about every other file that needs to be transferred. Fortunately, this is easy.\n\n\nHere is a Python script that takes the name of an input file (containing one word per line) from the command line, counts the number of times each (lowercased) word occurs in the text, and prints out the final list of words and their counts.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \n'Usage: \n%s\n DATA'\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n]))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\ninput_filename\n \n=\n \nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n\nwords\n \n=\n \n{}\n\n\n\nmy_file\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ninput_filename\n,\n \n'r'\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nline\n \nin\n \nmy_file\n:\n\n    \nword\n \n=\n \nline\n.\nstrip\n()\n.\nlower\n()\n\n    \nif\n \nword\n \nin\n \nwords\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n:\n\n        \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nmy_file\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\n\nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nsorted\n(\nwords\n.\nkeys\n()):\n\n    \nprint\n \n'\n%8d\n \n%s\n'\n \n%\n \n(\nwords\n[\nword\n],\n \nword\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Python script in a file named \nfreq.py\n.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the input file for the script (263K lines, ~1.4 MB) and save it in your submit directory:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool20/intro-2.1-words.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a submit file for the \nfreq.py\n executable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line to tell HTCondor to transfer the input file:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = intro-2.1-words.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all submit file commands, it does not matter where this line goes, as long as it comes before the word \nqueue\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not forget to add a line to name the input file as the argument to the Python script.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the output!\n\n\n\n\nIf things do not work the first time, keep trying! At this point in the exercises, we are telling you less and less explicitly how to do steps that you have done before. If you get stuck, ask for help in the #intro-to-htc Slack channel.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you want to transfer more than one input file, list all of them on a single \ntransfer_input_files\n command,\nseparated by commas.\nFor example, if there are three input files:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = a.txt, b.txt, c.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferring Output Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have relied on programs that send their output to the standard output and error streams, which HTCondor captures, saves, and returns back to the submit directory. But what if your program writes one or more files for its output? How do you tell HTCondor to bring them back?\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a job creates in the sandbox.\nWe will use a very simple method for creating a new file: we will copy an input file to another name.\n\n\n\n\nFind or create a small input file (it is fine to use any small file from a previous exercise).\n\n\nCreate a submit file that transfers the input file and copies it to another name (as if doing \n/bin/cp input.txt output.txt\n on the command line)\n\n\nMake the output filename different than any filenames that are in your submit directory\n\n\nWhat is the \nexecutable\n line?\n\n\nWhat is the \narguments\n line?\n\n\nHow do you tell HTCondor to transfer the input file?\n\n\nAs always, use \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and \nlog\n filenames that are different from previous exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job and wait for it to finish.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Can you tell what HTCondor did with the output file that was created (did it end up back on the submit server?), after it was created in the job sandbox? Look carefully at the list of files in your submit directory now.\n\n\nTransferring Specific Output Files\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs you saw in the last exercise, by default HTCondor transfers files that are created in the job sandbox back to the submit directory when the job finishes. In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back \nchanged\n input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and \nnot\n for ones contained in subdirectories.\n\n\nWhat if you want to bring back only \nsome\n output files, or output files contained in subdirectories?\n\n\nHere is a shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory:\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$#\n -ne \n1\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n \necho\n \n\"Usage: \n$0\n INPUT\"\n;\n \nexit\n \n1\n;\n \nfi\n\ndate > output-timestamp.txt\ncal > output-calendar.txt\nmkdir subdirectory\ncp \n$1\n subdirectory/backup-\n$1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory:\n\n\n\n\nSave the shell script in a file named \noutput.sh\n.\n\n\nWrite a submit file that transfers an input file and runs \noutput.sh\n on it (passing the filename as an argument).\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you decide that you want only the timestamp output file and all files in the subdirectory, but not the calendar output file. You can tell HTCondor to transfer these specific files:\n\n\ntransfer_output_files = output-timestamp.txt, subdirectory/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSee the trailing slash (\n/\n) on the subdirectory?\nThat tells HTCondor to transfer back \nthe files\n contained in the subdirectory, but not the directory itself;\nthe files will be written directly into the submit directory.\nIf you want HTCondor to transfer back an entire directory, leave off the trailing slash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove all output files from the previous run, including \noutput-timestamp.txt\n and \noutput-calendar.txt\n.\n\n\nCopy the previous submit file that ran \noutput.sh\n and add the \ntransfer_output_files\n line from above.\n\n\nSubmit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory.\n\n\n\n\nDid it work as you expected?\n\n\nThinking About Progress So Far\n\u00b6\n\n\nAt this point, you can do just about everything that you need in order to run jobs on a local HTC pool. You can identify the executable, arguments, and input files, and you can get output back from the job. This is a big achievement!\n\n\nIn some ways, everything after this exercise shows you how to submit multiple jobs at once and makes it easier to run certain kinds of jobs and deal with certain kinds of situations.\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are many more details about HTCondor\u2019s file transfer mechanism not covered here.\nFor more information, read \n\"Submitting Jobs Without a Shared Filesystem\"\n in the HTCondor Manual.",

The files are:           .chirp.config  Configuration for an advanced feature    .job.ad  The job ClassAd    .machine.ad  The machine ClassAd    _condor_stderr  Saved standard error from the job    _condor_stdout  Saved standard output from the job    condor_exec.exe  The executable, renamed from  sandbox.sh    tmp/ ,  var/tmp/  Directories in which to put temporary files     So, HTCondor wrote copies of the job and machine ads (for use by the job, if desired), transferred your executable ( sandbox.sh ), renamed it ( condor_exec.exe ), ran it, and saved its standard output and standard error into files. Notice that your submit file, which was in the same directory on the submit machine as your executable, was  not  transferred, nor were any other files that happened to be in directory with the submit file.  Now that we know something about the sandbox, we can transfer more files to and from it.",

Let\u2019s start by exploring what happens to files that a job creates in the sandbox.\nWe will use a very simple method for creating a new file: we will copy an input file to another name.

In fact, HTCondor will also transfer back  changed  input files, too. But, this only works for files that are in the top-level sandbox directory, and  not  for ones contained in subdirectories.  What if you want to bring back only  some  output files, or output files contained in subdirectories?  Here is a shell script that creates several files, including a copy of an input file in a new subdirectory:  #!/bin/sh  if   [   $#  -ne  1   ] ;   then   echo   \"Usage:  $0  INPUT\" ;   exit   1 ;   fi \ndate > output-timestamp.txt\ncal > output-calendar.txt\nmkdir subdirectory\ncp  $1  subdirectory/backup- $1   First, let\u2019s confirm that HTCondor does not bring back the output file in the subdirectory:   Save the shell script in a file named  output.sh .  Write a submit file that transfers an input file and runs  output.sh  on it (passing the filename as an argument).  Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and examine the contents of your submit directory.

Note the slightly different message from \ncondor_submit\n:\n\n\n3 job(s) submitted to cluster *NNNN*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the jobs execute, look at the job queue to see the multiple jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is some sample \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output:\n\n\n ID       OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD\n\n\n10228.0   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n10228.1   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n10228.2   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sample, all three jobs are part of \ncluster\n \n10228\n, \nbut the first job was assigned \nprocess\n \n0\n, \nthe second job was assigned process \n1\n, \nand the third one was assigned process \n2\n.\n(Programmers like to start counting from 0.)\n\n\nNow we can understand what the first column in the output, the \njob ID\n, represents.\nIt is a job\u2019s cluster number, a dot (\n.\n), and the job\u2019s process number.\nSo in the example above, the job ID of the second job is \n10228.1\n.\n\n\nPop Quiz:\n Do you remember how to ask HTCondor to list all of the jobs from one cluster? How about one specific job ID?\n\n\nUsing queue \nN\n With Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen all three jobs in your single cluster are finished, examine the resulting files.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is in the output file?\n\n\nWhat is in the error file (hopefully nothing)?\n\n\nWhat is in the log file? Look carefully at the job IDs in each event.\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Process) to Distinguish Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs you saw with the experiment above, each job ended up overwriting the same output and error filenames in the submission directory.\nAfter all, we didn't tell it to behave any differently when it ran three jobs.\nWe need a way to separate output (and error) files \nper job that is queued\n, not just for the whole cluster of jobs. Fortunately, HTCondor has a way to separate the files easily.\n\n\nWhen processing a submit file, HTCondor will replace any instance of \n$(Process)\n with the process number of the job, for each job that is queued. \nFor example, you can use the \n$(Process)\n variable to define a separate output file name for each job:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Process).out\nqueue 10\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variables are sometimes called \"submit macros\".\n\n\nEven though the \noutput\n filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst job\n\n\nmy-output-file-0.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond job\n\n\nmy-output-file-1.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird job\n\n\nmy-output-file-2.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast (tenth) job\n\n\nmy-output-file-9.out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see how this works for our program that estimates \u03c0.\n\n\n\n\nIn your submit file, change the definitions of \noutput\n and \nerror\n to use \n$(Process)\n in the filename, similar to the example above.\n\n\nDelete any output, error, and log files from previous runs.\n\n\nSubmit the updated file.\n\n\n\n\nWhen all three jobs are finished, examine the resulting files again.\n\n\n\n\nHow many files are there of each type? What are their names?\n\n\nIs this what you expected? Is it what you wanted from the \u03c0 estimation process?\n\n\n\n\nUsing $(Cluster) to Separate Files Across Runs\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith \n$(Process)\n, you can get separate output (and error) filenames for each job within a run. However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well.\n\n\nIn addition to \n$(Process)\n, there is also a \n$(Cluster)\n variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like \n$(Process)\n, except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used \nwith\n \n$(Process)\n, it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this \noutput\n statement:\n\n\noutput = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one particular run, it might result in output filenames like \nmy-output-file-2444-0.out\n, \nmyoutput-file-2444-1.out\n, \nmyoutput-file-2444-2.out\n, etc.\n\n\nHowever, the next run would have different filenames, replacing \n2444\n with the new Cluster number of that run.\n\n\nUsing $(Process) and $(Cluster) in Other Statements\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \n$(Cluster)\n and \n$(Process)\n variables can be used in any submit file statement, although they are useful in some kinds of submit file statements and not really for others. For example, consider using $(Cluster) or $(Process) in each of the below:\n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n\ntransfer_input_files\n\n\ntransfer_output_files\n\n\narguments\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, HTCondor does not easily let you perform math on the \n$(Process)\n number when using it. So, for example, if you use \n$(Process)\n as a numeric argument to a command, it will always result in jobs getting the arguments 0, 1, 2, and so on. If you have control over your program and the way in which it uses command-line arguments, then you are fine. Otherwise, you might need a solution like those in the next exercises.\n\n\n(Optional) Defining JobBatchName for Tracking\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring the lecture, it was mentioned that you can define arbitrary attributes in your submit file, and that one purpose of such attributes is to track or report on different jobs separately. In this optional exercise, you will see how this technique can be used.\n\n\nOnce again, we will use \nsleep\n jobs, so that your jobs remain in the queue long enough to experiment on.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a submit file that runs \nsleep 120\n (or some reasonable duration).\n\n\n\n\nInstead of a single \nqueue\n statement, write this:\n\n\njobbatchname = 1\nqueue 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, quickly edit the submit file to instead say:\n\n\njobbatchname = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the file again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck on the submissions using a normal \ncondor_q\n and \ncondor_q -nobatch\n. Of course, your special attribute does not appear in the \ncondor_q -nobatch\n output, but it is present in the \ncondor_q\n output and in each job\u2019s ClassAd. You can see the effect of the attribute by limiting your \ncondor_q\n output to one type of job or another. First, run this command:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -constraint \n'JobBatchName == \"1\"'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you get the output that you expected? Using the example command above, how would you list your other five jobs?\n(More on constraints in later exercises.)",

Before the jobs execute, look at the job queue to see the multiple jobs    Here is some sample  condor_q -nobatch  output:   ID       OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD  10228.0   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000  10228.1   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000  10228.2   cat             7/25 11:57   0+00:00:00 I  0    0.7 circlepi 1000000000   In this sample, all three jobs are part of  cluster   10228 , \nbut the first job was assigned  process   0 , \nthe second job was assigned process  1 , \nand the third one was assigned process  2 .\n(Programmers like to start counting from 0.)  Now we can understand what the first column in the output, the  job ID , represents.\nIt is a job\u2019s cluster number, a dot ( . ), and the job\u2019s process number.\nSo in the example above, the job ID of the second job is  10228.1 .

Fortunately, HTCondor has a way to separate the files easily.  When processing a submit file, HTCondor will replace any instance of  $(Process)  with the process number of the job, for each job that is queued. \nFor example, you can use the  $(Process)  variable to define a separate output file name for each job:  output = my-output-file-$(Process).out\nqueue 10  These variables are sometimes called \"submit macros\".  Even though the  output  filename is defined only once, HTCondor will create separate output filenames for each job:           First job  my-output-file-0.out    Second job  my-output-file-1.out    Third job  my-output-file-2.out    ...  ...    Last (tenth) job  my-output-file-9.out     Let\u2019s see how this works for our program that estimates \u03c0.   In your submit file, change the definitions of  output  and  error  to use  $(Process)  in the filename, similar to the example above.  Delete any output, error, and log files from previous runs.  Submit the updated file.   When all three jobs are finished, examine the resulting files again.   How many files are there of each type? What are their names?  Is this what you expected?

However, the next time you submit the same file, all of the output and error files are overwritten by new ones created by the new jobs. Maybe this is the behavior that you want. But sometimes, you may want to separate files by run, as well.  In addition to  $(Process) , there is also a  $(Cluster)  variable that you can use in your submit files. It works just like  $(Process) , except it is replaced with the cluster number of the entire submission. Because the cluster number is the same for all jobs within a single submission, it does not separate files by job within a submission. But when used  with   $(Process) , it can be used to separate files by run. For example, consider this  output  statement:  output = my-output-file-$(Cluster)-$(Process).out  For one particular run, it might result in output filenames like  my-output-file-2444-0.out ,  myoutput-file-2444-1.out ,  myoutput-file-2444-2.out , etc.  However, the next run would have different filenames, replacing  2444  with the new Cluster number of that run.",

So, for example, if you use  $(Process)  as a numeric argument to a command, it will always result in jobs getting the arguments 0, 1, 2, and so on.

As mentioned in the lecture, HTCondor provides many ways to submit jobs for this task.

First, here is a new version of the script (note, we removed the 'top n words' restriction):\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \noperator\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \n'Usage: \n%s\n DATA'\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n]))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\ninput_filename\n \n=\n \nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n]\n\n\n\nwords\n \n=\n \n{}\n\n\n\nmy_file\n \n=\n \nopen\n(\ninput_filename\n,\n \n'r'\n)\n\n\nfor\n \nline\n \nin\n \nmy_file\n:\n\n    \nline_words\n \n=\n \nline\n.\nsplit\n()\n\n    \nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nline_words\n:\n\n        \nif\n \nword\n \nin\n \nwords\n:\n\n            \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n+=\n \n1\n\n        \nelse\n:\n\n            \nwords\n[\nword\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nmy_file\n.\nclose\n()\n\n\n\nsorted_words\n \n=\n \nsorted\n(\nwords\n.\nitems\n(),\n \nkey\n=\noperator\n.\nitemgetter\n(\n1\n))\n\n\nfor\n \nword\n \nin\n \nsorted_words\n:\n\n    \nprint\n \n'\n%s\n \n%8d\n'\n \n%\n \n(\nword\n[\n0\n],\n \nword\n[\n1\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the script:\n\n\n\n\nSave it as \nwordcount.py\n.\n\n\nVerify the script by running it on one book manually.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file to submit one job (pick a book file and model your submit file off of the one above)\n\n\n\n\nModify the following submit file statements to work for all books:\n\n\ntransfer_input_files = $(book) \narguments = $(book) \noutput = $(book).out \nerror = $(book).err \nqueue book matching *.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAs always, the order of statements in a submit file does not matter, except that the \nqueue\n statement should be last.

For each job, the given variable (e.g., \nbook\n here) is assigned the name of the matching file, so that it can be used in \noutput\n, \nerror\n, and other statements.\n\n\nThe result is the same as if we had written out a much longer submit file:\n\n\n...\n\ntransfer_input_files = AAiW.txt\narguments = \"AAiW.txt\"\noutput = AAiW.txt.out\nerror = AAiW.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = PandP.txt\narguments = \"PandP.txt\"\noutput = PandP.txt.out\nerror = PandP.txt.err\nqueue\n\ntransfer_input_files = TAoSH.txt\narguments = \"TAoSH.txt\"\noutput = TAoSH.txt.out\nerror = TAoSH.txt.err\nqueue\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many jobs were created? Is this what you expected? If you ran this in the\nsame directory as Exercise 2.3, you may have noticed that a job was submitted\nfor the \nbooks_n.txt\n file that holds the variable values in the \nqueue from\n\nstatement. Beware the dangers of matching more files than intended! One\nsolution may be to put all of the books into an \nbooks\n directory and \nqueue\nmatching books/*.txt\n. Can you think of other solutions? If you have time, try one!\n\n\nExtra Challenge 1\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the example above, you used a single log file for all three jobs. HTCondor handles this situation with no problem; each job writes its events into the log file without getting in the way of other events and other jobs. But as you may have seen, it may be difficult for a person to understand the events for any particular job in the combined log file.\n\n\nCreate a new submit file that works just like the one above, except that each job writes its own log file.\n\n\nExtra Challenge 2\n\u00b6\n\n\nBetween this exercise and the previous one, you have explored two of the three primary \nqueue\n statements.

You have already seen that the default mode is to show only your jobs in \"batch\" mode:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q\n\n\n\n\n\nYou've seen that you can view all jobs (all users) in the submit node's queue by using the \n-all\n argument:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you've seen that you can view more details about queued jobs, with each separate job on a single line using the \n-nobatch\n option:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -nobatch\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all -nobatch\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know you can also name one or more user IDs on the command line, in which case jobs for all of the named users are listed at once?\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <USERNAME1> <USERNAME2> <USERNAME3>\n\n\n\n\n\nTo list just the jobs associated with a single cluster number:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <CLUSTER>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the jobs in cluster 5678 (i.e., \n5678.0\n, \n5678.1\n, etc.), you use \ncondor_q 5678\n.\n\n\nTo list a specific job (i.e., cluster.process, as in 5678.0):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q <JOB.ID>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see job ID 5678.1, you use \ncondor_q 5678.1\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can name more than one cluster, job ID, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case jobs for\n\nall\n of the named clusters and/or job IDs are listed.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_q\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit several \nsleep\n jobs.\n\n\nList all jobs in the queue \u2014 are there others besides your own?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_q\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList just your jobs, with and without batching.\n\n\nList a specific cluster.\n\n\nList a specific job ID.\n\n\nTry listing several users at once.\n\n\nTry listing several clusters and job IDs at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen there are a variety of jobs in the queue, try combining a username and a different user's cluster or job ID in the same command \u2014 what happens?\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Job ClassAd\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have wondered why it is useful to be able to list a single job ID using \ncondor_q\n. By itself, it may not be that useful. But, in combination with another option, it is very useful!\n\n\nIf you add the \n-long\n option to \ncondor_q\n (or its short form, \n-l\n), it will show the complete ClassAd for each selected job, instead of the one-line summary that you have seen so far. Because job ClassAds may have 80\u201390 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single job at a time. And you know how to show just one job! Here is what the command looks like:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -long <JOB.ID>\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_q\n output (except with some line breaks added to the \nRequirements\n attribute):\n\n\nMyType = \"Job\"\nErr = \"sleep.err\"\nUserLog = \"/home/cat/intro-2.1-queue/sleep.log\"\nRequirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory ) &&\n        ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )\nClusterId = 2420\nWhenToTransferOutput = \"ON_EXIT\"\nOwner = \"cat\"\nCondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\"\nOut = \"sleep.out\"\nCmd = \"/bin/sleep\"\nArguments = \"120\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAttributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time.\nDo not assume anything about the order of attributes in \ncondor_q\n output.\n\n\n\n\nSee what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a previous exercise, submit a \nsleep\n job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (180 seconds).\n\n\n\n\nBefore the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file:\n\n\ncondor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file\n\n\ncondor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for:\n\n\n\n\nCan you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth)\n\n\nCan you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements)\n\n\nHow many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of?\n\n\nDiskUsage\n\n\nImageSize\n\n\nBytesSent\n\n\nJobStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Is My Job Not Running?\n\u00b6\n\n\nSometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help.\n\n\nTo ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the \n-better-analyze\n option to \ncondor_q\n for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -better-analyze \n2423\n.0\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, replace the job ID with your own.\n\n\nLet\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use:\n\n\nexecutable = /bin/hostname\noutput = norun.out\nerror = norun.err\nlog = norun.log\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\nrequest_disk = 10MB\nrequest_memory = 8TB\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n(Do you see what I did?)\n\n\n\n\nSave and submit this file.\n\n\nRun \ncondor_q -better-analyze\n on the job ID.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with some lines omitted):\n\n\n-- Schedd: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.100.148:9618?...\n...\n\nJob 98096.000 defines the following attributes:\n\n    RequestDisk = 10240\n    RequestMemory = 8388608\n\nThe Requirements expression for job 98096.000 reduces to these conditions:\n\n\n         Slots\nStep    Matched  Condition\n-----  --------  ---------\n[1]       11227  Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7\n[9]       13098  TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk\n[11]          0  TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory\n\nNo successful match recorded.\nLast failed match: Fri Jul 12 15:36:30 2019\n\nReason for last match failure: no match found\n\n98096.000:  Run analysis summary ignoring user priority.  Of 710 machines,\n    710 are rejected by your job's requirements\n      0 reject your job because of their own requirements\n      0 match and are already running your jobs\n      0 match but are serving other users\n      0 are able to run your job\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of the summary, \ncondor_q\n provides a breakdown of how \nmachines\n and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 710 total machines were considered above, and \nall\n of them were rejected based on \nmy job's requirements\n. In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what?\n\n\nFurther up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 13098 slots match our small disk request request, but \nnone\n of the slots matched the \nTARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory\n condition. The output also reports the value used for the \nRequestMemory\n attribute: my job asked for \n8 terabytes\n of memory (8,388,608 MB) -- of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines.\n\n\nThe output from \ncondor_q -analyze\n (and \ncondor_q -better-analyze\n) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching.\n\n\nBonus: Automatic Formatting Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nDo this exercise only if you have time, though it's pretty awesome!\n\n\nThere is a way to select the specific job attributes you want \ncondor_q\n to tell you about with the \n-autoformat\n or \n-af\n option. In this case, HTCondor decides for you how to format the data you ask for from job ClassAd(s). \n(To tell HTCondor how to specially format this information, yourself, you could use the \n-format\n option, which we're not covering.)\n\n\nTo use autoformatting, use the \n-af\n option followed by the attribute name, for each attribute that you want to output:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_q -all -af Owner ClusterId Cmd\n\nmoate 2418 /share/test.sh\n\n\ncat 2421 /bin/sleep\n\n\ncat 2422 /bin/sleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus Question\n: If you wanted to print out the \nRequirements\n expression of a job, how would you do that with \n-af\n? Is the output what you expected? (HINT: for ClassAd attributes like \"Requirements\" that are long expressions, instead of plain values, you can use \n-af:r\n to view the expressions, instead of what it's current evaluation.)\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_q\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about ClassAd attributes in Appendix A of the HTCondor Manual",

Here is what the command looks like:  username@learn $  condor_q -long <JOB.ID>  The output from this command is long and complex. Most of the attributes that HTCondor adds to a job are arcane and uninteresting for us now. But here are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from  condor_q  output (except with some line breaks added to the  Requirements  attribute):  MyType = \"Job\"\nErr = \"sleep.err\"\nUserLog = \"/home/cat/intro-2.1-queue/sleep.log\"\nRequirements = ( IsOSGSchoolSlot =?= true ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Arch == \"X86_64\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.OpSys == \"LINUX\" ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk ) &&\n        ( TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory ) &&\n        ( TARGET.HasFileTransfer )\nClusterId = 2420\nWhenToTransferOutput = \"ON_EXIT\"\nOwner = \"cat\"\nCondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\"\nOut = \"sleep.out\"\nCmd = \"/bin/sleep\"\nArguments = \"120\"   Note  Attributes are listed in no particular order and may change from time to time.\nDo not assume anything about the order of attributes in  condor_q  output.   See what you can find in a job ClassAd from your own job.   Using a previous exercise, submit a  sleep  job that sleeps for at least 3 minutes (180 seconds).   Before the job executes, capture its ClassAd and save to a file:  condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-1.txt     After the job starts execution but before it finishes, capture its ClassAd again and save to a file  condor_q -l <JOB.ID> > classad-2.txt     Now examine each saved ClassAd file. Here are a few things to look for:   Can you find attributes that came from your submit file? (E.g., Cmd, Arguments, Out, Err, UserLog, and so forth)  Can you find attributes that could have come from your submit file, but that HTCondor added for you? (E.g., Requirements)  How many of the following attributes can you guess the meaning of?  DiskUsage  ImageSize  BytesSent  JobStatus",

            "text": "Sometimes, you submit a job and it just sits in the queue in Idle state, never running. It can be difficult to figure out why a job never matches and runs. Fortunately, HTCondor can give you some help.  To ask HTCondor why your job is not running, add the  -better-analyze  option to  condor_q  for the specific job. For example, for job ID 2423.0, the command is:  username@learn $  condor_q -better-analyze  2423 .0  Of course, replace the job ID with your own.  Let\u2019s submit a job that will never run and see what happens. Here is the submit file to use:  executable = /bin/hostname\noutput = norun.out\nerror = norun.err\nlog = norun.log\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\nrequest_disk = 10MB\nrequest_memory = 8TB\nqueue  (Do you see what I did?)   Save and submit this file.  Run  condor_q -better-analyze  on the job ID.   There is a lot of output, but a few items are worth highlighting. Here is a sample from my own job (with some lines omitted):  -- Schedd: learn.chtc.wisc.edu : <128.104.100.148:9618?...\n...\n\nJob 98096.000 defines the following attributes:\n\n    RequestDisk = 10240\n    RequestMemory = 8388608\n\nThe Requirements expression for job 98096.000 reduces to these conditions:\n\n\n         Slots\nStep    Matched  Condition\n-----  --------  ---------\n[1]       11227  Target.OpSysMajorVer == 7\n[9]       13098  TARGET.Disk >= RequestDisk\n[11]          0  TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory\n\nNo successful match recorded.\nLast failed match: Fri Jul 12 15:36:30 2019\n\nReason for last match failure: no match found\n\n98096.000:  Run analysis summary ignoring user priority.

At the end of the summary,  condor_q  provides a breakdown of how  machines  and their own requirements match against my own job's requirements. 710 total machines were considered above, and  all  of them were rejected based on  my job's requirements . In other words, I am asking for something that is not available. But what?  Further up in the output, there is an analysis of the job's requirements, along with how many slots within the pool match each of those requirements. The example above reports that 13098 slots match our small disk request request, but  none  of the slots matched the  TARGET.Memory >= RequestMemory  condition. The output also reports the value used for the  RequestMemory  attribute: my job asked for  8 terabytes  of memory (8,388,608 MB) -- of course no machines matched that part of the expression! That's a lot of memory on today's machines.  The output from  condor_q -analyze  (and  condor_q -better-analyze ) may be helpful or it may not be, depending on your exact case. The example above was constructed so that it would be obvious what the problem was. But in many cases, this is a good place to start looking if you are having problems matching.",

But this limitation is true of all \ncondor_status\n output, not just with the \n-avail\n option.\n\n\nSimilar to \ncondor_q\n, you can limit the slots that are listed in two easy ways. To list just the slots on a specific machine:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status <hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to see the slots on \ne2337.chtc.wisc.edu\n (in the CHTC pool):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status e2337.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nTo list a specific slot on a machine:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status <slot>@<hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to see the \u201cfirst\u201d slot on the machine above:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status slot1@e2337.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can name more than one hostname, slot, or combination thereof on the command line, in which case slots for\n\nall\n of the named hostnames and/or slots are listed.\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s get some practice using \ncondor_status\n selections!\n\n\n\n\nList all slots in the pool \u2014 how many are there total?\n\n\nPractice using all forms of \ncondor_status\n that you have learned:\n\n\nList the available slots.\n\n\nList the slots on a specific machine (e.g., \ne2337.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\nList a specific slot from that machine.\n\n\nTry listing the slots from a few (but not all) machines at once.\n\n\nTry using a mix of hostnames and slot IDs at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing a Slot ClassAd\n\u00b6\n\n\nJust as with \ncondor_q\n, you can use \ncondor_status\n to view the complete ClassAd for a given slot (often confusingly called the \u201cmachine\u201d ad):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -long <slot>@<hostname>\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause slot ClassAds may have 150\u2013200 attributes (or more), it probably makes the most sense to show the ClassAd for a single slot at a time, as shown above.\n\n\nHere are some examples of common, interesting attributes taken directly from \ncondor_status\n output:\n\n\nOpSys = \"LINUX\"\nDetectedCpus = 24\nOpSysAndVer = \"SL6\"\nMyType = \"Machine\"\nLoadAvg = 0.99\nTotalDisk = 798098404\nOSIssue = \"Scientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon)\"\nTotalMemory = 24016\nMachine = \"e242.chtc.wisc.edu\"\nCondorVersion = \"$CondorVersion: 8.5.5 May 03 2016 BuildID: 366162 $\"\nMemory = 1024\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may be able to tell, there is a mix of attributes about the machine as a whole (hence the name \u201cmachine ad\u201d) and about the slot in particular.\n\n\nGo ahead and examine a machine ClassAd now. I suggest looking at one of the slots on, say, \ne2337.chtc.wisc.edu\n because of its relatively simple configuration.\n\n\nViewing Slots by ClassAd Expression\n\u00b6\n\n\nOften, it is helpful to view slots that meet some particular criteria. For example, if you know that your job needs a lot of memory to run, you may want to see how many high-memory slots there are and whether they are busy. You can filter the list of slots like this using the \n-constraint\n option and a ClassAd expression.\n\n\nFor example, suppose we want to list all slots that are running Scientific Linux 7 (operating system) and have at least 16 GB memory available. Note that memory is reported in units of Megabytes. The command is:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -constraint \n'OpSysAndVer == \"CentOS7\" && Memory >= 16000'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBe very careful with using quote characters appropriately in these commands.\nIn the example above, the single quotes (\n'\n) are for the shell, so that the entire expression is passed to\n\ncondor_status\n untouched, and the double quotes (\n\"\n) surround a string value within the expression itself.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently on CHTC, there are only a few slots that meet these criteria (our high-memory servers, mainly used for metagenomics assemblies).\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about writing ClassAd expressions, look at section 4.1 and especially 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual. This is definitely advanced material, so if you do not want to read it, that is fine. But if you do, take some time to practice writing expressions for the \ncondor_status -constraint\n command.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \ncondor_q\n command accepts the \n-constraint\n option as well!\nAs you might expect, the option allows you to limit the jobs that are listed based on a ClassAd expression.\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Formatting Output\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \ncondor_status\n command accepts the same \n-autoformat\n (\n-af\n) options that \ncondor_q\n accepts, and the options have the same meanings in both commands. Of course, the attributes available in machine ads may differ from the ones that are available in job ads. Use the HTCondor Manual or look at individual slot ClassAds to get a better idea of what attributes are available.\n\n\nFor example, I was curious about the host name and operating system of the slots with more than 32GB of memory:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_status -af Machine -af OpSysAndVer -constraint \n'Memory >= 32000'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like, spend a few minutes now or later experimenting with \ncondor_status\n formatting.\n\n\nReferences\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs suggested above, if you want to learn more about \ncondor_q\n, you can do some reading:\n\n\n\n\nRead the \ncondor_status\n man page or HTCondor Manual section (same text) to learn about more options\n\n\nRead about \nClassAd attributes\n in the appendix of the HTCondor Manual\n\n\nRead about \nClassAd expressions\n in section 4.1.4 of the HTCondor Manual",

In the real world, we would probably just fix the program, but what if you cannot change the software? Unfortunately, this situation happens more often than we would like.\n\n\nBelow is a Python script that fails once in a while.\nWe will not fix it, but instead use it to simulate a program that can fail and that we \ncannot\n fix.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\n\n\n# murphy.py simulates a real program with real problems\n\n\nimport\n \nrandom\n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \ntime\n\n\n\n# For one out of every three attempts, simulate a runtime error\n\n\nif\n \nrandom\n.\nrandint\n(\n0\n,\n \n2\n)\n \n==\n \n0\n:\n\n    \n# Intentionally don't print any output\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n15\n)\n\n\nelse\n:\n\n    \ntime\n.\nsleep\n(\n3\n)\n\n    \nprint\n(\n\"All work done correctly\"\n)\n\n\n\n# By convention, zero exit code means success\n\n\nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n0\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor.\n\n\n\n\nIn a new directory for this exercise, save the script above as \nmurphy.py\n.\n\n\nWrite a submit file for the script; \nqueue 20\n instances of the job and be sure to ask for 20\u00a0MB of memory and disk.\n\n\nSubmit the file, note the ClusterId, and wait for the jobs to finish.\n\n\n\n\nWhat output do you expect? What output did you get? If you are curious about the exit code from the job, it is saved in completed jobs in \ncondor_history\n in the \nExitCode\n attribute. The following command will show the \nExitCode\n for a given cluster of jobs:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_history <CLUSTER> -af ProcId ExitCode\n\n\n\n\n\n(Be sure to replace \n<cluster>\n with your actual cluster ID. The command may take a minute or so to complete.)\n\n\nHow many of the jobs succeeded? How many failed?\n\n\nRetrying Failed Jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow let\u2019s see if we can solve the problem of jobs that fail once in a while. In this particular case, if HTCondor runs a failed job again, it has a good chance of succeeding. Not all failing jobs are like this, but in this case it is a reasonable assumption.\n\n\nFrom the lecture materials, implement the \nmax_retries\n feature to retry any job with a non-zero exit code up to 5 times, then resubmit the jobs. Did your change work?\n\n\nAfter the jobs have finished, examine the log file(s) to see what happened in detail. Did any jobs need to be restarted? Another way to see how many restarts there were is to look at the \nNumJobStarts\n attribute of a completed job with the \ncondor_history\n command, in the same way you looked at the \nExitCode\n attribute earlier.

Below is a Python script that fails once in a while.\nWe will not fix it, but instead use it to simulate a program that can fail and that we  cannot  fix.  #!/usr/bin/env python3  # murphy.py simulates a real program with real problems  import   random  import   sys  import   time  # For one out of every three attempts, simulate a runtime error  if   random . randint ( 0 ,   2 )   ==   0 : \n     # Intentionally don't print any output \n     sys . exit ( 15 )  else : \n     time . sleep ( 3 ) \n     print ( \"All work done correctly\" )  # By convention, zero exit code means success  sys . exit ( 0 )   Let\u2019s see what happens when a program like this one is run in HTCondor.

From the lecture materials, implement the  max_retries  feature to retry any job with a non-zero exit code up to 5 times, then resubmit the jobs. Did your change work?  After the jobs have finished, examine the log file(s) to see what happened in detail. Did any jobs need to be restarted?

Gaining access is\ncritical for all remaining exercises.\n\n\nLog in to the OSG submit server\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor some of the remaining exercises in this topic, you will be using a server named \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n.\nTo log in to this server, you will be using the username and SSH key that you setup when you registered for OSG Connect.\nIf you no longer have this information, please ask your mentor for help.\n\n\nOnce you have your account details, \nssh\n in to the server and take a look around.\n\n\nPreparing files for transfer\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen transferring files between computers, it's best to limit the number of files as well as their size.\nSmaller files transfer more quickly and if your network connection drops, restarting the transfer is less painful than\nit would be if you were transferring large files.\n\n\nArchiving tools (WinZip, 7zip, Archive Utility, etc.) can compress the size of your files and place them into a single,\nsmaller archive file.\nThe \ntar\n command is a one-stop shop for creating, extracting, and viewing the contents of \ntar\n archives (called\ntarballs) whose usage is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \ncreate\n a tarball named \n<archive filename>\n containing \n<archive contents>\n, use the following command:\n\n\nuser@learn $\n tar -czvf <archive filename> <archive contents>\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \n<archive filename>\n should end in \n.tar.gz\n and \n<archive contents>\n can be a list of any number of files\nand/or folders, separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \nextract\n the files from a tarball into the current directory:\n\n\nuser@learn $\n tar -xzvf <archive filename>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo \nlist\n the files within a tarball:\n\n\nuser@learn $\n tar -tzvf <archive filename>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the above knowledge, log into \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, create a tarball that contains the Grid exercise 1 directory,\nand verify that it contains all the proper files.\n\n\nComparing compressed sizes\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can adjust the level of compression of \ntar\n by prepending your command with \nGZIP=--<COMPRESSION>\n, where\n\n<COMPRESSION>\n can be either \nfast\n for the least compression, or \nbest\n for the most compression (the default\ncompression is between \nbest\n and \nfast\n).\n\n\n\n\nLog in to \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\nCreate and change into a new folder for this exercise, for example \ngrid-ex2\n\n\nUse \nwget\n to download the following files from our web server:\n\n\nText file: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool19/random_text\n\n\nArchive: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool19/pdbaa.tar.gz\n\n\nImage: \nhttp://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool19/obligatory_cat.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \ntar\n on each file and use \nls -l\n to compare the sizes of the original file and the compressed version.\n\n\n\n\nWhich files were compressed the least? Why?\n\n\nTransferring files\n\u00b6\n\n\nUsing secure copy\n\u00b6\n\n\nSecure copy\n (\nscp\n) is a command based on \nSSH\n that lets you securely copy\nfiles between two different servers.\nIt takes similar arguments to the \ncp\n command that you are familiar with but also takes additional server information:\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n scp <\nsource\n \n1\n> <\nsource\n \n2\n>...<\nsource\n N> \n[\nusername@\n]\n<remote server>:<remote path>\n\n\n\n\n\n<remote path>\n may be excluded if you want to copy your sources to your remote home directory and \n[username@]\n may be\nexcluded if your usernames are the same across both servers.\nFor example, if I were logged in to \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n and wanted to copy the file \nfoo\n from my current directory to\nmy home directory on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, the command would look like this:\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n scp foo learn.chtc.wisc.edu:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I could also pull files from  \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n to \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n.\nThe following command copies \nbar\n from my home directory on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n to my current directory on\n\nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n:\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n scp s20_user@learn.chtc.wisc.edu:bar .\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also copy folders between servers using the \n-r\n option.\nIf I kept all my files from the HTC exercise 1.3 in a folder named \nhtc-1.3\n on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n, I could use\nthe following command to copy them to my home directory on \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n:\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n scp -r s20_user@learn.chtc.wisc.edu:htc-1.3 .\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n, try copying the tarball you created earlier in this exercise on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n to\n\nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n.\n\n\nSecure copy from your laptop\n\u00b6\n\n\nDuring your research, you may need to retrieve output files from your submit server to inspect them on your personal\nserver, which can also be done with \nscp\n! To use \nscp\n on your laptop, follow the instructions relevant to your\nserver's operating system:\n\n\nMac and Linux users\n\u00b6\n\n\nscp\n should be included by default and available via the terminal on both Mac and Linux operating systems.\nOpen a terminal window on your laptop and try copying the tarball containing the Grid exercise 1 from\n\nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n to your laptop.\n\n\nWindows users\n\u00b6\n\n\nWinSCP is an \nscp\n client for Windows operating systems.\n\n\n\n\nInstall WinSCP from \nhttps://winscp.net/eng/index.php\n\n\nStart WinSCP and enter your SSH credentials for \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n\n\nCopy the tarball containing Grid exercise 1 to your laptop\n\n\n\n\nExtra challenge: Using rsync\n\u00b6\n\n\nscp\n is a great, ubiquitous tool for one-time transfers but there are better tools if you find yourself transferring\nthe same set of files to the same location repeatedly.\nAnother common tool available on many Linux server is \nrsync\n, which is like a beefed-up version of \nscp\n.\nThe invocation is similar to \nscp\n: you can transfer files and/or folders, but the options are different and when\ntransferring folders, make sure they don't have a trailing slash (\n/\n, this means to copy all the files within the\nfolder instead of the folder itself):\n\n\nuser@learn $\n rsync -Pavz <\nsource\n \n1\n> <\nsource\n \n2\n>...<\nsource\n N> \n[\nusername@\n]\n<remote server>:<remote path>\n\n\n\n\n\nrsync\n has many benefits over \nscp\n but two of its biggest features are built-in compression (so you don't have to\ncreate a tarball) and the ability to only transfer files that have changed.\nBoth of these feature are helpful when you're having connectivity issues so that you don't have to restart the transfer\nfrom scratch every time your connection fails.\n\n\n\n\nLog in to \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n\n\nUse \nrsync\n to transfer the folder containing Grid exercise 1 on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n to \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n\n\nIn a separate terminal window, log in to \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new file in your Grid exercise 1 folder on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n with the \ntouch\n command:\n\n\nuser@learn $\n touch <filename>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n, use the same \nrsync\n command to transfer the folder with the new file you just created.\n   How many files were transferred the first time? How many files were transferred if you run the same rsync command\n   again?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext exercise\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce completed, move onto the next exercise: \nRunning jobs in the OSG",

A wrapper script can either install the software from the source code, or use an already existing software (as in this exercise). Not only does this portability technique work with almost any kind of software that can be locally installed, it also allows for a great deal of control and flexibility for what happens within your job.

This exercise should take 5-10 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere is a large amount of scientific software that is available as source code. Source code is usually a group of text files (code) meant to be downloaded and then compiled into a \nbinary file\n which a computer can understand. Sometimes the source code depends on other pieces of code called libraries. If the source code is linked \nstatically\n, these libraries are bundled into the compilation with the source code, creating a \nstatic binary\n which can be run on any computer with the same operating system.\n\n\nOur Software Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor this compiling example, we will use a script written in C. C code depends on libraries and therefore will benefit from being statically linked.\n\n\nOur C code prints 7 rows of Pascal's triangle.\n\n\n\n\nLog into the OSG submit node \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n. Create a directory for this exercise and \ncd\n into it.\n\n\nCopy and paste the following code into a file named \npascal.c\n.\n#include\n \n\"stdio.h\"\n\n\n\nlong\n \nfactorial\n(\nint\n);\n\n\n\nint\n \nmain\n()\n\n\n{\n\n\nint\n \ni\n,\n \nn\n,\n \nc\n;\n\n\nn\n=\n7\n;\n\n\nfor\n \n(\ni\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \ni\n \n<\n \nn\n;\n \ni\n++\n){\n\n  \nfor\n \n(\nc\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \nc\n \n<=\n \n(\nn\n \n-\n \ni\n \n-\n \n2\n);\n \nc\n++\n)\n\n  \nprintf\n(\n\" \"\n);\n\n      \nfor\n \n(\nc\n \n=\n \n0\n \n;\n \nc\n \n<=\n \ni\n;\n \nc\n++\n)\n\n         \nprintf\n(\n\"%ld \"\n,\nfactorial\n(\ni\n)\n/\n(\nfactorial\n(\nc\n)\n*\nfactorial\n(\ni\n-\nc\n)));\n\n      \nprintf\n(\n\"\n\\n\n\"\n);\n\n   \n}\n\n   \nreturn\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nlong\n \nfactorial\n(\nint\n \nn\n)\n\n\n{\n\n   \nint\n \nc\n;\n\n   \nlong\n \nresult\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n   \nfor\n \n(\nc\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n \nc\n \n<=\n \nn\n;\n \nc\n++\n)\n\n         \nresult\n \n=\n \nresult\n*\nc\n;\n\n   \nreturn\n \nresult\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiling\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to use this code in a job, we will first need to statically compile the code. Recall the slide from the lecture - where \ncan\n we compile and where \nshould\n we compile? In particular:\n\n\n\n\nWhere is the compiler available?\n\n\nHow computationally intensive will this compilation be?    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about these questions before moving on. Where do you think we should compile?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost linux servers (including our submit node) have the \ngcc\n (GNU compiler collection) installed, so we already have a compiler on the submit node. Furthermore, this is a simple piece of C code, so the compilation will not be computationally intensive. Thus, we should be able to compile directly on the submit node. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile the code, using the command: \n\n\nusername@login $\n gcc -static pascal.c -o pascal\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have added the \n-static\n option to make sure that the compiled binary includes the necessary libraries. This will allow the code to run on any Linux machine, no matter where those libraries are located. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the compiled binary was statically linked:\n\n\nusername@login $\n file pascal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Linux \nfile\n command provides information about the \ntype\n or \nkind\n of file that is given as an argument. In this case, you should get output like this:\n\n\nusername@host $\n file pascal\n\npascal: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), \nstatically linked\n,\n\n\nfor GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the blue text, which clearly states that this executable (software) is statically linked. The same command run on a non-statically linked executable file would include the text \ndynamically linked (uses shared libs)\n instead. So with this simple verification step, which could even be run on files that you did not compile yourself, you have some further reassurance that it is safe to use on other Linux machines. (Bonus exercise: Try the \nfile\n command on lots of other files)\n\n\nSubmit the Job\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow that our code is compiled, we can use it to submit a job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about what submit file lines we need to use to run this job:\n\n\n\n\nAre there input files?\n\n\nAre there command line arguments?\n\n\nWhere is its output written?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on what you thought about in 1., find a submit file from earlier that you can modify to run our compiled \npascal\n code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy it to the directory with the \npascal\n binary and make those changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job using \ncondor_submit\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the job has run and left the queue, you should be able to see the results (seven rows of Pascal's triangle) in the \n.out\n file created by the job.",

It should take 30-35 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nSome software cannot be compiled into a single executable, whether you compile it yourself (as in \nSoftware Exercise 2.1\n) or download it already compiled (as in \nSoftware Exercise 1.1\n). In this case, it is necessary to download or create a portable copy of the software and then use a wrapper script (as in \nthis exercise\n) to \"install\" or run the software on a per job basis. This script can either install the software from the source code, or (as in this exercise), unpack a portable software package that you've pre-built yourself.\n\n\nOur Software Example\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor this exercise, we will be using the Bayseian inference package OpenBUGS. OpenBUGS is a good example of software that is not compiled to a single executable; it has multiple executables as well as a helper library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo an internet search to find the Open BUGS software downloads page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise on the CHTC submit server \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n (\nnot\n \ntraining.osgconnect.net\n), \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause you can't download the OpenBUGS source tarball directly, download it from our \"squid\" webserver: \n\n\nusername@learn $\n wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool20/OpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Prepare\n\u00b6\n\n\nOur goal is to pre-build an OpenBUGS installation, and then write a script that will unpack that installation and run a simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can we create this pre-built installation? Based on the end of the lecture, what are our options and which would be most appropriate? Make a guess before moving on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we're on the CHTC-based submit node (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n), we have the option of using an interactive job to build the OpenBUGS installation. This is a good option because the submit server is already busy with lots of users and we don't know how long the OpenBUGS install will take. We'll also target specific build servers with extra tools by adding some special requirements to our interactive job. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the following lines into a file named \nbuild.submit\n\n\nlog = build.log\n\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\ntransfer_input_files =\n\n+IsBuildJob = true\nrequirements = (IsBuildSlot == true)\n\nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequest_disk = 2GB\nrequest_memory = 2GB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the lack of executable. Condor doesn't need an executable for this job because it will be interactive, meaning \nyou\n are running the commands instead of Condor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to create the installation, we will need the source code to come with us. The \ntransfer_input_files\n line is blank - \nfill it in with the name of our Open BUGS source tarball\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo request an interactive job, we will add a \n-i\n flag to the \ncondor_submit\n command. The whole command you enter should look like this: \n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit -i build.submit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Through Installation Documentation\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhile you're waiting for the interactive job to start, you can start reading the Open BUGS installation documentation online.\n\n\n\n\nFind the installation instructions for Open BUGS.\n\n\nOn the downloads page, there are short instructions for how to install Open BUGS. There are two options shown for installation -- which should we use?\n\n\nThe first installation option given uses \nsudo\n -- which is an administrative permission that you won't have as a normal user. Luckily, as described in the instructions, you can use the \n--prefix\n option to set where Open BUGS will be installed, which will allow us to install it without administrative permissions.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\u00b6\n\n\nYour interactive job should have started by now and we've learned about installing our program. Let's test it out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we follow the installation instructions, we should create a directory to hold our installation. You can create this in the current directory. \n\n\nusername@host $\n mkdir openbugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow run the commands to unpack the source code: \n\n\nusername@host $\n tar -zxf OpenBUGS-3.2.3.tar.gz\n\nusername@host $\n \ncd\n OpenBUGS-3.2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can follow the second set of installation instructions.

Add the following lines to your \nrun_openbugs.sh\n wrapper script. \n\n\nOpenBUGS < input.txt > results.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the wrapper script has executable permissions: \n\n\nusername@learn $\n chmod u+x run_openbugs.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun a Open BUGS job\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe're almost ready!

It should take about 20 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe chose Python as the language for this example because: a) it is a common language used for scientific computing and b) it has a straightforward installation process and is fairly portable.\n\n\nRunning any Python script requires an installation of the Python interpreter. The Python interpreter is what we're using when we type \npython\n at the command line. In order to run Python jobs on a distributed system, you will need to install the Python interpreter (what we often refer to as just \"installing Python\"), within the job, then run your Python script.\n\n\nThere are two installation approaches. The approach we will cover in this exercise is that of \"pre-building\" the installation. We will install Python to a specific directory, and then create a tarball of that installation directory. We can then use our tarball within jobs to run Python scripts.\n\n\nInteractive Job for Pre-Building\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first step in our job process is building a Python installation that we can package up.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise on \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n and \ncd\n into it.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Python source code from \nhttps://www.python.org/\n. \n\n\nusername@learn $\n wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/Python-3.7.0.tgz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf our options - submit server, interactive job, personal computer - which should we use for this installation/packaging process? Once you have a guess, move to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the number of people on our submit server, we shouldn't use the submit server. Your own computer probably doesn't have the right operating system. The best place to install will be an interactive job. For this job, we can use the same interactive submit file as Exercise 2.2, with one change. What is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of the interactive submit file from \nExercise 2.2\n and change the \ntransfer_input_files\n line to the Python tarball you just downloaded. Then submit it using the \n-i\n flag. \n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit -i build.submit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the interactive job begins, we can start our installation process. First, we have to determine how to install Python to a specific location in our working directory.\n\n\n\n\nUntar the Python source tarball and look at the \nREADME.rst\n file in the \nPython-3.7.0\n directory.  You'll want to look for the \"Build Instructions\" header.  What will the main installation steps be?  What command is required for the final installation?  Once you've tried to answer these questions, move to the next step.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some basic installation instructions near the top of the \nREADME\n. Based on that short introduction, we can see the main steps of installation will be: \n\n\n./configure\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n\n\nThis three-stage process (configure, make, make install) is a common  way to install many software packages.   The default installation  location for Python requires \nsudo\n (administrative privileges) to install. However, we'd like to install to a specific location in the working directory  so that we can compress that installation directory into a tarball. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can often use an option called \n-prefix\n with the \nconfigure\n script to change the default installation directory. Let's see if the Python \nconfigure\n script has this option by using the \"help\" option (as suggested in the \nREADME.rst\n file): \n\n\nusername@host $\n ./configure --help\n\n\n\n\n\nSure enough, there's a list of all the different options that can be passed to the \nconfigure\n script, which includes \n--prefix\n.  (To see the \n--prefix\n option, you may need to scroll towards the top of the output.)  Therefore, we can use the  \n$PWD\n command in order to set the path correctly to a custom installation directory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's actually install Python!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the job's main working directory\n, create a directory to hold the installation. \n\n\nusername@host $\n \ncd\n \n$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR\n\n\nusername@host $\n mkdir python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove into the \nPython-3.7.0\n directory and run the installation commands. These may take a few minutes each. \n\n\nusername@host $\n \ncd\n Python-3.7.0\n\nusername@host $\n ./configure --prefix\n=\n$PWD\n/../python\n\nusername@host $\n make\n\nusername@host $\n make install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe installation instructions in the \nREADME.rst\n file have a \nmake test\n step \nbetween the \nmake\n and \nmake install\n steps.  As this step isn't strictly necessary (and takes a long time), it's been omitted above.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I move back to the main job working directory, and look in the \npython\n subdirectory, I should see a Python installation. \n\n\nusername@host $\n \ncd\n ..\n\nusername@host $\n ls python/\n\nbin  include  lib  share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have successfully created a self-contained Python installation. Now it just needs to be tarred up! \n\n\nusername@host $\n tar -czf prebuilt_python.tar.gz python/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exiting, we might want to know how we installed Python for later reference.  Enter the following commands to save our history to a file: \n\n\nusername@host $\n \nhistory\n > python_install.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExit the interactive job. \n\n\nusername@host $\n \nexit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython Script\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a script with the following lines called \nfib.py\n. \n\n\nimport\n \nsys\n\n\nimport\n \nos\n\n\n\nif\n \nlen\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n)\n \n!=\n \n2\n:\n\n    \nprint\n(\n'Usage: \n%s\n MAXIMUM'\n \n%\n \n(\nos\n.\npath\n.\nbasename\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n0\n])))\n\n    \nsys\n.\nexit\n(\n1\n)\n\n\nmaximum\n \n=\n \nint\n(\nsys\n.\nargv\n[\n1\n])\n\n\nn1\n \n=\n \nn2\n \n=\n \n1\n\n\nwhile\n \nn2\n \n<=\n \nmaximum\n:\n\n    \nn1\n,\n \nn2\n \n=\n \nn2\n,\n \nn1\n \n+\n \nn2\n\n\nprint\n(\n'The greatest Fibonacci number up to \n%d\n is \n%d\n'\n \n%\n \n(\nmaximum\n,\n \nn1\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat command line arguments does this script take? Try running it on the submit server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapper Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe now have our Python installation and our Python script - we just need to write a wrapper script to run them.\n\n\n\n\nWhat steps do you think the wrapper script needs to perform? Create a file called \nrun_fib.sh\n and write them out in plain English before moving to the next step.\n\n\nOur script will need to\n\n\nuntar our \nprebuilt_python.tar.gz\n file\n\n\naccess the \npython\n command from our installation to run our \nfib.py\n script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry turning your plain English steps into commands that the computer can run.\n\n\n\n\nYour final \nrun_fib.sh\n script should look something like this: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ntar -xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz \npython/bin/python3 fib.py \n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\ntar -xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz \n\nexport\n \nPATH\n=\n$(\npwd\n)\n/python/bin:\n$PATH\n \npython3 fib.py \n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your \nrun_fib.sh\n script is executable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit File\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a copy of a previous submit file in your local directory (the OpenBugs submit file could be a good starting point).

Let's see if the Python  configure  script has this option by using the \"help\" option (as suggested in the  README.rst  file):   username@host $  ./configure --help  Sure enough, there's a list of all the different options that can be passed to the  configure  script, which includes  --prefix .  (To see the  --prefix  option, you may need to scroll towards the top of the output.)  Therefore, we can use the   $PWD  command in order to set the path correctly to a custom installation directory.       Now let's actually install Python!    From the job's main working directory , create a directory to hold the installation.   username@host $   cd   $_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR  username@host $  mkdir python    Move into the  Python-3.7.0  directory and run the installation commands. These may take a few minutes each.   username@host $   cd  Python-3.7.0 username@host $  ./configure --prefix = $PWD /../python username@host $  make username@host $  make install   Note  The installation instructions in the  README.rst  file have a  make test  step \nbetween the  make  and  make install  steps.  As this step isn't strictly necessary (and takes a long time), it's been omitted above.       If I move back to the main job working directory, and look in the  python  subdirectory, I should see a Python installation.   username@host $   cd  .. username@host $  ls python/ bin  include  lib  share     I have successfully created a self-contained Python installation. Now it just needs to be tarred up!   username@host $  tar -czf prebuilt_python.tar.gz python/      Before exiting, we might want to know how we installed Python for later reference.  Enter the following commands to save our history to a file:   username@host $   history  > python_install.txt    Exit the interactive job.   username@host $   exit",

This exercise will draw on the idea of writing a wrapper script to install and run code, first introduced in \nExercise 1.2\n and should take 25-30 minutes.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nMatlab is licensed; however, unlike most licensed software, it has the ability to be compiled and the compiled code can be run without a license. We will be compiling Matlab \n.m\n files into a binary file and running that binary using a set of files called the Matlab runtime.\n\n\nMatlab Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nLog in to the CHTC submit server (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise and \ncd\n into it . \n\n\nCopy the following code into a file called \nmatrix.m\n \nA = randi(100,4,4)\nb = randi(100,4,1);\nx = A*b\nsave results.txt x -ascii\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiling Matlab Code\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first step in making Matlab portable is compiling our Matlab script.\nTo compile this code, we need to access the machines with the Matlab compiler installed.\nFor this exercise, we will use the compilers installed on special CHTC build machines.\nIn the CHTC pool, you can't use \nssh\n to directly connect to these machines.\nInstead, you must submit an interactive job (similar to \nExercise 2.2\n) that\nspecifically requests these build machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called \ncompile.submit\n with the lines below: \n\n\nlog = compile.log\n\nshould_transfer_files = YES\nwhen_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT\ntransfer_input_files = matrix.m\n\n+IsBuildJob = true\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 512MB\n\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can initiate the interactive job by using \ncondor_submit\n 's \n-i\n option. Enter the following command: \n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit -i compile.submit\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you've submitted this command from \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n! Once the job starts, continue with the following instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince you are a guest user on our system, you will need to set your \nHOME\n directory by running this command: \n\n\nusername@build $\n \nexport\n \nHOME\n=\n$PWD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Matlab software on these build servers is accessible via modules, just like the software installed on OSG Connect. Check which modules are available and then load the older version of Matlab. \n\n\nusername@build $\n module load MATLAB/R2015b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the module is loaded (you can check by running \nmodule list\n), compile the \nmatrix.m\n file with this command: \n\n\nusername@build $\n mcc -m -R -singleCompThread -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm matrix.m\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extra arguments to the \nmcc\n command are very important here. Matlab, by default, will run on as many CPUs as it can find. This can be a big problem  when running on someone else's computers, because your Matlab code might interfere with what the owner wants. The \n-singleCompThread\n option  compiles the code to run on a single CPU, avoiding this problem. In addition, the \n-nodisplay\n and \n-nojvm\n options turn off the display (which won't exist  where the code runs). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo exit the interactive session, type \nexit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you're back on the submit server, look at the files that were created by the Matlab compiler. Which one is the compiled binary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatlab Runtime\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe newly compiled binary will require the 2015b Matlab runtime to run. You can download the runtime from the Mathworks website and build it yourself, but to save time, for this exercise you can use the pre-built runtimes hosted by CHTC.\n\n\n\n\nDownload the 2015b Matlab runtime hosted by CHTC: \nusername@learn $\n wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/r2015b.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapper Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will need a wrapper script to open the Matlab runtime and then run our compiled Matlab code. Our wrapper script will need to accomplish the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nUnpack the transferred runtime\n\n\nSet the environment variables\n\n\nRun our compiled matlab code\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, the Matlab compiler has pre-written most of this wrapper script for us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at \nrun_matrix.sh\n. Which of the above steps do we need to add? Once you have an idea, move to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll need to add commands to unpack the runtime (which will have been transferred with the job). Add this line to the beginning of the \nrun_matrix.sh\n file, after \n#!/bin/bash\n and the comments, but before \nexe_name=$0\n : \n\n\ntar -xzf r2015b.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at \nreadme.txt\n to determine what arguments our wrapper script requires. Once you have an idea, move to the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the Matlab runtime directory is a required argument to the wrapper script \nrun_matrix.sh\n. We'll have to do a little extra work to find out the name of that directory. Run this command\n\n\ntar -tf r2015b.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the previous command is a list of all the files in the tar.gz file. What is the name of the first folder of the path for each file? This is the name of the runtime directory, and the argument you should pass to \nrun_matrix.sh\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting the Job\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy an existing submit file into your current directory. The submit file we used for  \nExercise 2.2\n example would be a good candidate, as that example also used a wrapper script. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nModify your submit file for this job. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your changes against the list below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nexecutable\n for this job is going to be our wrapper script \nrun_matrix.sh\n. \n\n\nexecutable = run_matrix.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to transfer the compiled binary \nmatrix\n, as well as the runtime \n.tar.gz\n file, using \ntransfer_input_files\n. \n\n\ntransfer_input_files = matrix, r2015b.tar.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe argument for the executable (\nrun_matrix.sh\n) is \"v90\", as that is the name of the un-tarred runtime directory. \n\n\narguments = v90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to request plenty of disk space for the runtime. \n\n\nrequest_disk = 2GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit the job using \ncondor_submit\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter it completes, the job should have produced a file called \nresults.txt\n.",

It builds on \nExercise 2.2\n from earlier, so only do this exercise if you've already done Exercise 2.2.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn Exercise 2.2, the wrapper scripts had all files and options written out explicitly. However, imagine if you wanted to run the same job multiple times, or even just try out one or two different options or inputs. Instead of writing new wrapper scripts for each job, you can modify the script so that some of the values are set by \narguments\n. Using script arguments will allow you to use the same script for multiple jobs, by providing different inputs or parameters. These arguments are normally passed on the command line:\n\n\nBut in our world of job submission, the arguments will be listed in the submit file, in the arguments line.\n\n\nIdentifying Potential Arguments\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nLog into your account on the submit server where you ran Exercise 2.2 (\nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n).\n\n\nFind the directory you used to submit Open BUGS jobs and open your \nrun_openbugs.sh\n wrapper script.\n\n\nWhat values might we want to input to the script via arguments? Hint: anything that we might want to change if we were to run the script many times.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, some values we might want to change are the name of the input and output file. These will be the arguments for our script.\n\n\nModifying Files\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the name of the input and output files and open the submit file. Add an arguments line if it doesn't already exist, and fill it with our two chosen arguments: the name of the input file and the name of the output file: \n\n\narguments = input.txt results.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow go back to the wrapper script.

These distribution tools are great \nfor creating portable Python installations and can be used on HTC systems with \nsome help from a tool called \nconda pack\n. \n\n\nCreate and Pack a Conda Environment\n\u00b6\n\n\n(For a generic version of these instructions, see the \nCHTC User Guide\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first step is to create a miniconda installation on the submit server. \n\n\n\n\nLog into either \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n or \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n\n\n\n\nDownload the latest Linux \nminiconda installer\n\n\nuser@login $\n wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the installer to install miniconda; you'll need to accept the license terms and \nyou can use the default installation location: \n\n\n[user@login]$\n sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end, you can choose whether or \nnot to \"initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init?\" The default is no; you would \nthen run the \neval\n command listed by the installer to \"activate\" Miniconda. If you\nchoose \"no\" you'll want to save this command so that you can reactivate the \nMiniconda installation when needed in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we'll create our conda \"environment\" with \nnumpy\n (we've called the environment \"py3-numpy\"): \n\n\n(base)\n[user@login]$\n conda create -n py3-numpy\n\n(base)\n[user@login]$\n conda activate py3-numpy\n\n(py3-numpy)\n[user@login]$\n conda install numpy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce everything is installed, deactivate the environment to go back to the \nMiniconda \"base\" environment.\n\n\n(py3-numpy)\n[user@login]$\n conda deactivate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll now install a tool that will pack up the just created conda environment \nso we can run it elsewhere. Make sure that your job's Miniconda environment is created, but deactivated, so \nthat you're in the \"base\" Miniconda environment, then run: \n\n\n(base)\n[user@login]$\n conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter \ny\n when it asks you to install. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we will run the \nconda pack\n command, which will automatically create a \ntar.gz file with our environment: \n\n\n(base)\n[user@login]$\n conda pack -n py3-numpy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a Job\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a copy of the \nrand_array.py\n script from the \nDocker Build Exercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe executable for this job will need to be a wrapper script. What steps do you \nthink need to be included? Write down a rough draft, then compare with the following script. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a wrapper script like the following: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nexport PATH\nmkdir py3-numpy\ntar -xzf py3-numpy.tar.gz -C py3-numpy\n. py3-numpy/bin/activate\n\npython3 rand_array.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat needs to be included in your submit file for the job to run successfully?

If you\nchoose \"no\" you'll want to save this command so that you can reactivate the \nMiniconda installation when needed in the future.

regardless of\nhow these files were arranged on the submit node.\nIn this exercise we'll use the same \nblastx\n example job that we used previously, but modify the submit file and test\nhow much memory and disk space it uses on the execute node.\n\n\nStart with a test submit file\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe've started a submit file for you, below, which you'll add to in the remaining steps.\n\n\nexecutable = \ntransfer_input_files = \noutput = test.out\nerror = test.err\nlog = test.log\nrequest_memory = \nrequest_disk = \nrequest_cpus = 1\nrequirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == \"RHEL 7\")\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nImplement file compression\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn our first blast job from the Software exercises (\n1.1\n), the database files in the \npdbaa\n directory were all transferred, as is, but we\ncould instead transfer them as a single, compressed file using \ntar\n.\nFor this version of the job, let's compress our blast database files to send them to the submit node as a single\n\ntar.gz\n file (otherwise known as a tarball), by following the below steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange into the \npdbaa\n directory and compress the database files into a single file called \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n\n    using the \ntar\n command.\n    Note that this file will be different from the \npdbaa.tar.gz\n file that you used earlier, because it will only\n    contain the \npdbaa\n files, and not the \npdbaa\n directory, itself.)\n\n\nRemember, a typical command for creating a tar file is:\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n tar -cvzf <COMPRESSED FILENAME> <LIST OF FILES OR DIRECTORIES>\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing \n<COMPRESSED FILENAME>\n with the name of the tarball that you would like to create and\n\n<LIST OF FILES OR DIRECTORIES>\n with a space-separated list of files and/or directories that you want inside pdbaa_files.tar.gz. \nMove the resulting tarball to the \nblast-data\n directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a wrapper script that will first decompress the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file, and then run blast.\n\n\nBecause this file will now be our \nexecutable\n in the submit file, we'll also end up transferring the \nblastx\n executable\nwith \ntransfer_input_files\n.\nIn the \nblast-data\n directory, create a new file, called \nblast_wrapper.sh\n, with the following contents:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\ntar -xzvf pdbaa_files.tar.gz\n\n./blastx -db pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out mouse.fa.result\n\nrm pdbaa.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra Files!\n\n\nThe last line removes the resulting database files that came from \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n, as these files would\notherwise be copied back to the submit server as perceived output since they're \"new\" files that HTCondor\ndidn't transfer over as input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList the executable and input files\n\u00b6\n\n\nMake sure to update the submit file with the following:\n\n\n\n\nAdd the new \nexecutable\n (the wrapper script you created above)\n\n\nIn \ntransfer_input_files\n, list the \nblastx\n binary, the \npdbaa_files.tar.gz\n file, and the input query file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommas, commas everywhere!\n\n\nRemember that \ntransfer_input_files\n accepts a comma separated list of files, and that you need to list the full\nlocation of the \nblastx\n executable (\nblastx\n).\nThere will be no arguments, since the arguments to the \nblastx\n command are now captured in the wrapper script.\n\n\n\n\nPredict memory and disk requests from your data\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlso, think about how much memory and disk to request for this job.\nIt's good to start with values that are a little higher than you think a test job will need, but think about:\n\n\n\n\nHow much memory \nblastx\n would use if it loaded all of the database files \nand\n the query input file into memory.\n\n\nHow much disk space will be necessary on the execute server for the executable, all input files, and all output\n    files (hint: the log file only exists on the submit node).\n\n\nwhether you'd like to request some extra memory or disk space, just in case\n\n\n\n\nLook at the \nlog\n file for your \nblastx\n job from Tuesday, and compare the memory and disk \"Usage\" to what you predicted\nfrom the files.\nMake sure to update the submit file with more accurate memory and disk requests (you may still want to request slightly\nmore than the job actually used).\n\n\nRun the test job\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have finished editing the submit file, go ahead and submit the job.\nIt should take a few minutes to complete, and then you can check to make sure that no unwanted files (especially the\n\npdbaa\n database files) were copied back at the end of the job.\n\n\nRun a \ndu -sh\n on the directory with this job's input.\nHow does it compare to the

This exercise should take 25-30 minutes.\n\n\nData\n\u00b6\n\n\nA copy of the movie files for this exercise have been placed in \n/public/osgvsp20\n, so that they'll be available to our jobs when they run out on OSG.\n\n\n\n\nLog into \nlogin04.osgconnect.net\n\n\nCreate a directory for this exercise named \nstash-unique\n and change into it.\n\n\nWe're going to need a list of these files later.  Below is the final list of movie files.  Because of the size, you do not need to download the files to your \n/public\n directory, and instead use the copies in the stash directory.\n    For now, let's save a list of the videos to a file in this directory.  Save it as \nmovie_list.txt\n: \nducks.mov\nteaching.mov\ntest_open_terminal.mov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe'll be using a multi-purpose media tool called \nffmpeg\n  to convert video formats.\nThe basic command to convert a file looks like this: \n\n\nuser@login04 $\n ./ffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to resize our files, we're going to manually set the video bitrate and resize the frames, so that the resulting\nfile is smaller.\n\n\nuser@login04 $\n ./ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 400k -s 640x360 output.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the \nffmpeg\n binary do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll be downloading the \nffmpeg\n pre-built static binary originally from this page: \nhttp://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/\n. \n\n\nuser@login04 $\n wget http://stash.osgconnect.net/public/osgvsp20/ffmpeg-release-64bit-static.tar.xz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the binary is downloaded, un-tar it, and then copy the main \nffmpeg\n program into your current directory: \n\n\nuser@login04 $\n tar -xf ffmpeg-release-64bit-static.tar.xz\n\nuser@login04 $\n cp ffmpeg-4.0.1-64bit-static/ffmpeg ./\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScript\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe want to write a script that runs on the worker node that uses \nffmpeg\n to convert a \n.mov\n file to a smaller format.\nOur script will need to:\n\n\n\n\nCopy\n that movie file from Stash to the job's current working directory (as in the\n   \nprevious exercise\n\n\nRun\n the appropriate \nffmpeg\n command\n\n\nRemove\n the original movie file so that it doesn't get transferred back to the submit server.\n   This last step is particularly important, as otherwise you will have large files transferring into the submit server\n   and filling up your local scratch directory space.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a file called \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n, that does the steps described above.\nUse the name of the smallest \n.mov\n file in the \nffmpeg\n command.\nAn example of that script is below: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nmodule load stashcache\nstashcp /osgconnect/public/osgvsp20/test_open_terminal.mov ./\n./ffmpeg -i test_open_terminal.mov -b:v 400k -s 640x360 test_open_terminal.mp4\nrm test_open_terminal.mov\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately we'll want to submit several jobs (one for each \n.mov\n file), but to start with, we'll run one job to make\nsure that everything works.\n\n\nSubmit File\n\u00b6\n\n\nCreate a submit file for this job, based on other submit files from the school\n(\nThis file, for example\n.)\nThings to consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll be copying the video file into the job's working directory, so make sure to request enough disk space for the\n    input \nmov\n file and the output \nmp4\n file.\n    If you're aren't sure how much to request, ask a helper in the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n Don't list the name of the \n.mov\n in \ntransfer_input_files\n. Our job will be interacting with the\n    input \n.mov\n files solely from within the script we wrote above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we \ndo\n need to transfer the \nffmpeg\n program that we downloaded above. \n\n\ntransfer_input_files = ffmpeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the same requirements as the previous exercise: \n\n\n+WantsStashCache = true\nrequirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == \"RHEL 7\") && (HAS_MODULES =?= true)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Job\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith everything in place, submit the job. Once it finishes, we should check to make sure everything ran as expected:\n\n\n\n\nCheck the directory where you submitted the job. Did the output \n.mp4\n file return?\n\n\nAlso in the directory where you submitted the job - did the original \n.mov\n file return here accidentally?\n\n\nCheck file sizes. How big is the returned \n.mp4\n file? How does that compare to the original \n.mov\n input?\n\n\n\n\nIf your job successfully returned the converted \n.mp4\n file and did \nnot\n transfer the \n.mov\n file to the submit\nserver, and the \n.mp4\n file was appropriately scaled down, then we can go ahead and convert all of the files we uploaded\nto Stash.\n\n\n\n\nHow to view your videos\n\n\nRemember how we used the stash web server when we used it to distribute our blast database?  You can use that web server to view the video files.  Just copy the \n.mp4\n video into your \n/public/<USERNAME>\n directory.  The file will be available at \nhttp://stash.osgconnect.net/public/<USERNAME>/<MP4_NAME>.mp4\n.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe wrote the name of the \n.mov\n file into our \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n executable script.\nTo submit a set of jobs for all of our \n.mov\n files, what will we need to change in:\n\n\n\n\nThe script?\n\n\nThe submit file?\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've thought about it, check your reasoning against the instructions below.\n\n\nAdd an argument to your script\n\u00b6\n\n\nLook at your \nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n script. What values will change for every job?\n\n\nThe input file will change with every job - and don't forget that the output file will too! Let's make them both into\narguments.\n\n\nTo add arguments to a bash script, we use the notation \n$1\n for the first argument (our input file) and \n$2\n for the\nsecond argument (our output file name).\nThe final script should look like this: \n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmodule load stashcache\nstashcp /osgconnect/public/osgvsp20/$1 ./\n./ffmpeg -i $1 -b:v 400k -s 640x360 $2\nrm $1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we use the input file name multiple times in our script, so we'll have to use \n$1\n multiple times as well.\n\n\nModify your submit file\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to tell each job what arguments to use.\n    We will do this by adding an arguments line to our submit file.\n    Because we'll only have the input file name, the \"output\" file name will be the input file name with the \nmp4\n\n    extension.\n    That should look like this: \n\n\narguments = $(mov) $(mov).mp4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set these arguments, we will use the \nqueue .. from\n syntax that we learned in the \n   \nHTC Exercise 2.3\n.\n   In our submit file, we can then change our queue statement to:\n\n\nqueue mov from movie_list.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've made these changes, try submitting all the jobs!\n\n\nBonus\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you wanted to set a different output file name, bitrate and/or size for each original movie, how could you modify:\n\n\n\n\nmovie_list.txt\n \n\n\nYour submit file \n\n\nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n\n\n\n\nto do so?\n\n\n\n  \nShow hint\n Here's the changes you can make to the various files:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmovie_list.txt\n \n\n\nducks.mov ducks.mp4 500k 1280x720\nteaching.mov teaching.mp4 400k 320x180\ntest_open_terminal.mov terminal.mp4 600k 640x360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit file\n\n\narguments = $(mov) $(mp4) $(bitrate) $(size)\n\nqueue mov,mp4,bitrate,size from movie_list.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrun_ffmpeg.sh\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nmodule load stashcache\nstashcp /osgconnect/public/osgvsp20/\n$1\n ./\n./ffmpeg -i \n$1\n -b:v \n$3\n -s \n$4\n \n$2\n\nrm \n$1",

After\nthe sweep runs, you need to collate the results.  This might look like this, assuming you want to sweep over five\nparameters:\n\n\n\n\nDAGMan has many abilities, such as throttling jobs, recovery from failures, and more.  More information about DAGMan can\nbe found at \nin the HTCondor manual\n.\n\n\nSubmitting a Simple DAG\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor our job, we will return briefly to the \nsleep\n program.\n\n\nexecutable              = /bin/sleep\narguments               = 4\nlog                     = simple.log\noutput                  = simple.out\nerror                   = simple.error\nrequest_memory = 1GB\nrequest_disk = 1GB\nrequest_cpus = 1\nqueue\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are going to get a bit more sophisticated in submitting our jobs now.  Let's have three windows open.  In one window,\nyou'll submit the job.  In another you will watch the queue, and in the third you will watch what DAGMan does.\n\n\nFirst we will create the most minimal DAG that can be created: a DAG with just one node.  Put this into a file named\n\nsimple.dag\n.\n\n\nJob Simple simple.sub\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your first window, submit the DAG:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit_dag

Let\u2019s make pretty pictures!\n\n\nWe have a small program that draws pictures of the Mandelbrot set. You can \nread about the Mandelbrot set on Wikipedia\n, or you can simply appreciate the pretty pictures. It\u2019s a fractal.\n\n\nWe have a simple program that can draw the Mandelbrot set. It's called \ngoatbrot\n.\n\n\nBefore beginning, ensure that you are connected to \nlearn.chtc.wisc.edu\n. Create a directory for this exercise and cd into it.\n\n\nRunning goatbrot From the Command Line\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can generate the Mandelbrot set as a quick test with two simple commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a PPM image of the Mandelbrot set:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n goatbrot -i \n1000\n -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c \n0\n,0 -w \n3\n -s \n1000\n,1000\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngoatbroat\n program takes several parameters. Let's break them down:\n\n\n\n\n-i 1000\n The number of iterations. Bigger numbers generate more accurate images but are slower to run.\n\n\n-o tile_000000_000000.ppm\n The output file to generate.\n\n\n-c 0,0\n The center point of the image. Here it is the point (0,0).\n\n\n-w 3\n The width of the image. Here is 3.\n\n\n-s 1000,1000\n The size of the final image. Here we generate a picture that is 1000 pixels wide and 1000 pixels tall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert the image to the JPEG format (using a built-in program called \nconvert\n):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n convert tile_000000_000000.ppm mandel.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividing the Work into Smaller Pieces\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Mandelbrot set can take a while to create, particularly if you make the iterations large or the image size large. What if we broke the creation of the image into multiple invocations (an HTC approach!) then stitched them together? Once we do that, we can run each \ngoatbroat\n in parallel in our cluster. Here's an example you can run by hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun goatbroat 4 times:\n\n\nusername@learn $\n goatbrot -i \n1000\n -o tile_000000_000000.ppm -c -0.75,0.75 -w \n1\n.5 -s \n500\n,500\n\nusername@learn $\n goatbrot -i \n1000\n -o tile_000000_000001.ppm -c \n0\n.75,0.75 -w \n1\n.5 -s \n500\n,500 \n\nusername@learn $\n goatbrot -i \n1000\n -o tile_000001_000000.ppm -c -0.75,-0.75 -w \n1\n.5 -s \n500\n,500 \n\nusername@learn $\n goatbrot -i \n1000\n -o tile_000001_000001.ppm -c \n0\n.75,-0.75 -w \n1\n.5 -s \n500\n,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStitch the small images together into the complete image (in JPEG format):\n\n\nusername@learn $\n montage tile_000000_000000.ppm tile_000000_000001.ppm tile_000001_000000.ppm tile_000001_000001.ppm -mode Concatenate -tile 2x2 mandel.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will produce the same image as above. We divided the image space into a 2\u00d72 grid and ran \ngoatbrot\n on each section of the grid.

DAGMan is built to help you recover from such failures.\n\n\nBackground\n\u00b6\n\n\nDAGMan can handle a situation where some of the nodes in a DAG fail. DAGMan will run as many nodes as possible, then create a rescue DAG making it easy to continue when the problem is fixed.\n\n\nBreaking Things\n\u00b6\n\n\nRecall that DAGMan decides that a jobs fails if its exit code is non-zero.

DAGMan ran as much of the DAG as possible and logged enough information to continue the run when the situation is resolved.

It will automatically notice the rescue DAG. If you didn't fix the problem, DAGMan would generate another rescue DAG.\n\n\nusername@learn $\n condor_submit_dag goatbrot.dag\n\nRunning rescue DAG

DAGMan ran as much of the DAG as possible and logged enough information to continue the run when the situation is resolved. Do you see the part where it wrote the resuce DAG?  Look at the rescue DAG file. It's called a partial DAG because it indicates what part of the DAG has already been completed.  username@learn $  cat goatbrot.dag.rescue001 #  Rescue DAG file, created after running #    the goatbrot.dag DAG file #  Created  6 /22/2012  23 :08:42 UTC #  Rescue DAG version:  2 .0.1  ( partial )  #  #  Total number of Nodes:  5  #  Nodes premarked DONE:  4  #  Nodes that failed:  1  #    montage,<ENDLIST> DONE g1  DONE g2  DONE g3  DONE g4   From the comment near the top, we know that the montage node failed.

Make a series of images where you zoom into a point in the Mandelbrot set gradually. (Those points above may work well.) Assemble these images with the \"convert\" tool which will let you convert a set of JPEG files into an MPEG movie.\n\n\nChallenge 3\n\u00b6\n\n\nTry out Pegasus.
