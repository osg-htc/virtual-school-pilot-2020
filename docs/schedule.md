# OSG-VSP Schedule

Below is the schedule for the OSG Virtual School Pilot 2020.  We will probably
make small changes up to and even during the event.  However, the overall plan
will probably not change much.

**All times are U.S. Central Daylight Time.**

Notes:

* Each lecture is offered twice on the same day.  Choose one time that is
  convenient for you or, if you like, attend both.  Lectures will be held in the
  Blackboard Collaborate video conference system; more details will be posted
  and emailed soon.

* Try to attend at least one Work Time per day.  This is time for you to work on
  exercises or getting your research code running.  During a Work Time, plan to
  be on Slack; from there, you can chat with staff and participants and, if
  needed, arrange individual or group audio/video meetings.

* Consultations are one-on-one meetings with your mentor.  You will work with
  your mentor to schedule exact times.
